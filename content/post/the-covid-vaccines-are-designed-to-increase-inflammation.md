**All of modern medicine is designed to maximize the lifetime value (LTV) of a customer**, aka, "the patient."

Once you realize that LTV is the purpose of medicine, you will never look at the medical industry the same way. You will see it, not a noble art, but as a cold business seeking to maximize shareholder value.

You will begin to realize that the shareholders in the medical industry are diverse and powerful. They include both for-profit and non-profit entities.

You might be tempted, as I am at times, to assume some grand conspiracy in the medical arts. And you could be right about that conspiracy. More likely, though, the conspiracy you see looking backward from the present was actually just run-of-the-mill self-interest unchecked by either market forces or moral sentiment.

This post will attempt an explanation for how we arrived at our present situation in which the medical industry—including research universities, hospital systems, government medical agencies, corporate human resource departments, doctor groups, insurance companies, and more—lost sight of human beings and embrace the Big Data with its promises of efficiency, manipulation, and every-growing profits. For that taudry list is the sum goal of modern medicine.

### The Lifetime Value of a Patient

Lifetime value of a customer is the total revenue extracted from a single customer from his first purchase to his last. Companies try to maximize the LTV by increasing a customers transactional:

* recency 
* frequency
* monetary value

The medical industry can't increase your recency, frequency, and monetary value through traditional loyalty practices. If you don't need medicine, you "lapse" or "attrite" as a customer. But a certain condition makes you more likely to provide a high lifetime value to the medical industry: systemic inflammation. 

Systemic inflammation is the number one cause of lifetime medical care. The more inflammation, the more money for medicine. 

On the other hand, the more inflammation, the more miserable the patient's life. 

Modern medicine uses disease management to minimize your suffering while maximizing the financial value of your diseases. It's just business. 

### Chronic vs. Acute Conditions

If you are my age or older, you can probably remember the emergence of the idea of "disease management." Back in the 1980s and 1990s, this phrase became common.

The idea, as explained to the uninitiated back then, was that some chronic conditions could not be "cured," but only managed. At first, this concept of disease management applied to things like kidney, liver, heart, and lung diseases, autoimmune problems, and the like. And it was a completely logical differentiation. Some conditions simply could not be reversed or cured, and the best medicine could do was to minimize the condition's effects on a person's life.

A doctor once told me that if he had it all to do over again, he would have become a dermatologist. "Their patients don't die and they never get better." In other words, dermatology patients provide a high lifetime value.

In medicine,  lifelong or long-lasting conditions are called "chronic." Chronic conditions promise the patient a lifetime of suffering or inconvenience and the provider a long-term, predictable revenue stream. 

Sure, the patient's personal physician might hold strong, human feelings for his suffering patient. But the industry sees only a customer with a high frequency of transactions and high monetary value. The system has no feelings. Or, as Don Draper said in an episode of _Mad Men_, "There is no system. The Universe is indifferent." The universe of medicine is, indeed, indifferent to the suffering of the individual patient but very eager for more suffering patients who live longer.

We can assume that individual, practicing physicians care about their patients, whereas the medical industry cares only about the lifetime value of its customers. Keep them alive as long as possible, so long as their condition remains management but not curable.

Contrast those chronic conditions with very short-lived conditions, like a broken leg or a gunshot wound. Or even plastic surgery.

These are one-and-done treatments. Setting the leg of a 12-year-old or an 80-year-old offers about the same lifetime revenue to the system. There could arise, of course, complications that require prolonged medical services, but, for the most part, doctors who treat broken legs have to keep finding newly broken legs to treat. 

I shattered a bone in my finger seven ways playing softball in 2001, saw an orthopedist exactly twice and never again. He made about $1,000 on the two visits.

If, however, I had been diagnosed with Type II diabetes in 2001, both my primary-care doctor and the specialists would have had income for life.

Acute medicine, while profitable, is less predictable than chronic medicine. Since the medical industry, like all big businesses, wants to forecast its future income and expenses, it prefers chronic diseases to acute injuries and conditions.

Again, _your_ doctor probably wants what is best for you. But your doctor is part of a universe that is indifferent to you. Its only desires are material. Big industries insulate themselves from moral sentiment on purpose. They have read both of Adam Smith's masterworks and decided sentiment is too expensive and unpredictable. Sentiment must be frozen out of the decision-making process, leaving only cold, hard numbers. You might be "Joe" to your doctor, but you are a mere input to an algorithm to your doctor's universe.

The consultant's motto is: "If you can't be part of the solution, there's good money in prolonging the problem."We could say of the medical industry: "If you can't find a cure, there's good money in prolonging the suffering." Again, this probably does not apply to the doctor you see once a year or every week, but it does apply to your doctor's business.

Let us stipulate that chronic disease is better for the business of medicine than acute conditions. So what causes chronic disease?

### Inflammation Drives LTV

Inflammation is the key driver of chronic disease. Therefore, inflammation is the lifeblood of modern medicine. Specifically, systemic inflammation is the fuel that powers modern medicine. 

Chronic, systemic inflammation increases the likelihood of almost every chronic illness that costs patients a lot of money and provides the medical industry a lot of income. Here is a very short list of the kinds of diseases associated with inflammation, from the National Institutes of Health:

* Susceptibility to bacterial, fungal, and viral infections
* Acid reflux
* Cancer
* Skin conditions like psoriasis and acne
* Arthritis
* Bronchitis
* Chronic pain
* Diabetes
* High blood pressure
* Osteoporosis
* Heart disease
* Candidiasis
* Urinary tract infections
* Dementia
* Parkinson's Disease

We are talking here about chronic, systemic inflammation. Inflammation is not always bad, of course. Inflammation is the body's natural and curative response to stressors. Let us examine my broken finger as an example of good inflammation.

I broke my finger in the second inning of the first game of a doubleheader. I was playing first base and dove for a line drive. The ball ticked off the tip of the ring finger of my throwing hand and deflected miraculously into my glove. I did a shoulder roll, came up throwing, and nailed a runner who had abandoned second base assuming I would not catch the drive.

When I released that beautiful throw to the shortstop, a long arc of blood followed the softball like a tracer about half way to second base. I heard players "ewing" at the grotesque site. A bone shard had broken through the skin and pushed my fingernail almost completely off.

With twelve innings left to play that night, I went to my car and retrieved tape from my hockey bag. I wrapped the finger to hold the nail in place (I didn't realize the bone was broken and assumed the ball had pulled the nail off.) I finished both games, went to the bar with the team afterward, and went to work the next day.

Three days later, the finger, still wrapped in hockey tape, hurt worse than ever. I could no longer move the finger at all. So I went to urgent care for X-rays and was referred immediately to an orthopedist. "Your finger is broken into at least seven pieces," the urgent-care doctor told me. "It will almost definitely require a pin." The doctor replaced my homemade bandage with a loose-fitting finger splint and told me to avoid using the hand.

The following Tuesday, the orthopedist saw me and examined the  x-rays and the finger.

"I wouldn't advise someone to use hockey tape and wait three days to see a doctor," he said. "But the swelling combined with the tape actually moved the bone fragments right back to where they belong. Since it's been a week, you probably won't need a pin if you don't hit again for a couple of weeks."

He explained that, usually, people who suffer a broken bone take immediate measures to reduce swelling (a form of inflammation). Because I was too busy playing softball to worry about ice and analgesics, the finger inflamed dramatically. The tape, while loose when applied, caused the pressure to concentrate inward. The bone shards moved to the path of least resistance, which was, of course, the positions from which they began their journeys. In short, the jigsaw puzzle I'd made of my finger bone put itself back together thanks to inflammation.

The finger healed perfectly except for occasional arthritis stiffness from the acute stress of that softball injury. Other than that, no complications, no surgery, no pin.

That's how inflammation is supposed to work: it corrects things that get out of order in the body, both mechanical disorders, like broken bones, and systemic disorders, like invading viruses. 

But inflammation can become chronic. Smoking causes chronic inflammation of the lungs, the blood, and other organs. Chemicals can cause chronic inflammation, especially chemicals that get into our bodies that our bodies cannot remove. Pollen and airborne mold spores cause inflammation known as allergies. Stress from noise or fear causes inflammation, too.

The leading cause of chronic inflammation, however, is the American diet. We eat inflammatory foods every day. Foods laden with chemicals the body does not like, and diets that provide many times more sugary carbohydrates than our bodies were designed to process.

Carbohydrates, in fact, cause more chronic illness than smoking ever did. Yet, the US government and the medical industry drove us to this catastrophic situation.
