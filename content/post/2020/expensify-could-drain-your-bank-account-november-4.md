We have to ask: **are your data and money safe with Expensify**? 

Expensify's CEO David Barrett (@dbarrett) sent an email to his customers threatening civil war if Trump wins re-election. 

{{< twitter_simple  1319397164821348357 >}}

You think Barrett would bat an eye at manipulating the expense data or even **draining bank accounts of customers who support Trump**? Probably not. If I had an Expensify account, I'd close it now. Or, at least, disconnect any bank accounts. 

Put yourself in his shoes. Barrett thinks he has a moral duty to oppose Trump and Trump supporters, even to death. He seems willing to fund a civil war to that end. Civil wars need money, and he's not going to spend his own. He's rich; he's not going to spend his *own* money, sill.

([How to close your Expensify account](https://community.expensify.com/discussion/4520/how-to-close-your-account).)

Expensify connects to customers' bank accounts. Bank accounts of people and companies that support President Trump. Barrett believes that, if Trump wins, America is no longer America. Its laws and norms are defunct. 

Therefore, in Barrett's mind, he would have a moral duty to **steal the money from Trump supports** to fund his morally superior side in the civil war and to defund the enemy. In a sense, if Trump wins, Barrett believes he would be **obligated to steal your money**. Right out of your checking account.

Besides, Barrett has already stolen his company's database of customer emails to send an unsolicited (and probably illegal) political message. He does not believe in business ethics. 

Play it safe. **Close your Expensify account today**, and rescind Expensify's connection to your bank. You might want to change your online banking passwords, too. 

Hurry.

### UPDATE: Political Email Violated Expensify's Privacy Policy

Expensify's CEO David Barrett appears to have violated the company's privacy policy by using personal identifying information (PII) stored in its database as part of a partisan political campaign. 

Expensify is likely to update its privacy policy, so I saved a PDF of their policy as of today. (See end of this post.) No mention of political ads. 


Here's part of David Barrett's email to Expensify customers:
