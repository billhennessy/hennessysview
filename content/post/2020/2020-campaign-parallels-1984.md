The effects of the two presidential debates of 2020 followed a pattern similar to those of 1984. 

There were differences, of course. In 1984, Ronald Reagan went into the first debate with an 18-point margin in polling. Polling may have been more accurate, though, in 1984 than it is today simply because polling was less political. While Lou Harris admitted to placing his thumb on the scale for his paid clients, pollsters in 1984 still tried to reflect the actual sentiment of voters. Today, pollsters want to *shape* opinion, not analyze it. 

So, with nine days left until the 2020 elections, let's look at what happened between the 1984 debates and see if we can find any parallels in 2020. 

### 1984

In 1984, a lot of people thought Reagan was doomed to one term. 

The media bent over backwards to help his opponent, Walter Mondale. Mondale chose Rep. Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate, which fired up the feminist crowd. The left was rallying around a nuclear weapons freeze campaign on behalf of the Soviet Union. Even though Reagan consistently led in polls, pundits believed Mondale would win. 

And Mondale did win...his home state of Minnesota. Reagan won all the rest. 

But for a couple of weeks in early October that year, Mondale appeared poised to upset the Gipper because of the first presidential debate of the cycle. Here's how Slate described Reagan's performance in that first debate:

> This was bad. Reagan knew it was bad. “As soon as he left the stage,” reports Lou Cannon in President Reagan, “Reagan confessed to [adviser Stu] Spencer that he had flopped.” According to Jack Germond and Jules Witcover, when Mondale left the stage, he confided to an aide that “This guy is gone” – as in mentally not all there. Two days after the debate, RNC Chairman Paul Laxalt held a press conference admitting that Reagan had blown it, but “it wasn’t because of any physical or mental deficiency… he was brutalized by a briefing process that didn’t make any sense.” Why mention mental deficiency? Because the “drive-by media” was covering the debate that way, bringing on mental health experts to ask what the hell happened to Reagan. A Newsweek/Gallup poll found 54 percent of debate-watchers giving the victory to Mondale, and only 35 percent to Reagan.

Mondale jumped 7 points in the polls following the debate. Some Republicans were in a panic, especially the more establishment Republicans like Senator Lowell Weicker of Connecticut who never really warmed up to the conservative Reagan. 

But, then came the second debate. 

In the second debate of 1984, the old Gipper was back. Reagan did little debate prep, deciding to go out and be himself. "Let Reagan be Reagan," they said. And "himself" delivered one of the most memorable, game-changing moments in the history of politics:

Everyone remembers the brilliant line that dismissed the age question for good. But many don't remember what *really* short-circuited Mondale's surge: taxes.

Months earlier at the Democratic National Convention, Walter Mondale, in the biggest speech of his life, promised that, if elected, he would raise taxes. Republicans made Mondale's tax increase the centerpiece of their campaign. No one in America was in the mood for a tax hike just two years after Reagan's massive tax cuts gave everyone an effective pay raise and ignited what would become the longest economic expansion in US history.

### 2020

Donald Trump's performance in the first debate of 2020 was widely panned. People thought the President was too aggressive, interrupting his opponent Joe Biden more than 140 times. Even Trump allies complained that their man "saved" Joe Biden just as the aging Democrat started rambling incoherently, as he often does. 

The stock market even took a nosedive following that first debate of 2020. Investors feared a Biden win. 

Unlike Reagan's first debate performance of 1984, though, Trump's performance wasn't the result of too much preparation that stifled Trump's natural wit and charm. If anything, it was Trump being a little too Trumpian.

Just 48 hours after the first debate ended, President Trump revealed he and his wife Melania had contracted Coronavirus and would begin quarantine. At 74 years old and slightly overweight, many people wondered if the president would even survive. Polls already favorable to Biden widened. Trump looked like a one-term president. 

But Trump triumphed over Coronavirus, surprising even his staunchest supporters with the speed of his recovery. Having checked into Walter Reed Military Hospital the Friday evening after the debate, Trump emerged from its golden doors the following Monday looking healthy as ever. And the previous day the president felt well enough to take a ride in his limo to wave to hundreds of supporters holding a 72-hour vigil outside the hospital. 





But the 1984 race had
