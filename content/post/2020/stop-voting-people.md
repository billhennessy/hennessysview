Attorney Lin Wood says exactly what I'm feeling.

I agree completely with Lin Wood. If Georgia doesn't fix its system, no one should vote. Just don't vote, people. Just don't vote. 

As long as we keep voting, Republicans will keep letting you down. Every Georgian who votes on January 5 will be endorsing stolen elections and a stolen country. They will be voting for private government. 

It's time to hold Republicans accountable. We will not vote if you will not fight. 

Thank you.
