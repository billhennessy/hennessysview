The GOP has a cut a deal with the Deep State to get rid of Trump without destroying the party. (Or so they think.)

Here are the four pillars of this conspiracy.

### How the Deal Works

* GOP leaders agreed to ignore massive vote fraud in exchange for keeping the US Senate. 
* The election was rigged electronically, but ham-fisted and obvious "traditional" vote fraud was conducted as a smoke screen. 
* If Trump somehow prevails, Dems will take the Senate in the Georgia runoffs, and Trump will be impeached and removed by June.
* If Trump does not prevail, GOP will keep the Senate and remain a viable party in the future. 

Let's look at the evidence or reasoning for each of these four pillars. 

### GOP Agrees to Allow a Stolen Election


You've probably noticed that most big-name Republicans have said almost nothing about the massive and undeniable vote fraud that occurred on November 3 in Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, and Nevada. You are probably asking yourself "why?"

You ask "why" because GOP docility makes no sense. You know if GOP leaders (and you know who I mean) really believed Democrats could control the House, the Senate, and the White House, they'd be screaming bloody murder. They're smart enough to know that this scenario is the end of America as we know it.

If Democrats take over the government by fraud, they will never relinquish control. They will stack the Supreme Court and guarantee one-party rule in America for at least 100 years. And, if massive fraud works once, it will work again and again. Only an idiot would stop using a technique that works.

But Democrats in control of all three federal branches won't need 100 years to end the constitutional republic. Republicans like Lindsey Graham, Mitch McConnell, and David Perdue know this. 

A Democrat-run Supreme Court will simply re-interpret the Constitution out of existence. The First Amendment will apply strictly to "authorized and approved" religion, speech, assembly, and petition. The Second Amendment will apply only to government-authorized militias, which will be defined as police and sheriffs. The Fourth and Fifth Amendments will be redefined, as well. 

For Republican leaders to either sit out the election fraud fight means they know (or firmly believe) Democrats won't be in a position to stack the Supreme Court.
