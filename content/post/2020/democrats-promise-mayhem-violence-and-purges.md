You have been warned. 

Maybe Democrat-controlled radical groups just want to scare people. Maybe the Biden campaign decided its best strategy is to frighten Trump voters away from the polls. 

Or, maybe, the left is simply tired of waiting for nature to take its course and sweep in communism. Like Vladimir Lenin, these Neo-Marxists may want to accelerate what they believe the inevitable arrival a classless society. 

Whether idle threats or leaked plans for civil war, you must decide how to prepare for the possibility. If you choose to prepare for war and upheaval and nothing happens, you'll also be prepared for many disasters. If you choose to assume the left's threat is idle, though, being wrong has a steep downside.
