Please **do not share my posts on Twitter or Facebook**. 

Parler is the new Twitter, and MeWe is the new Facebook. If you love America, you'll move now.

**Twitter and Facebook make money every time you look at them**. People look at them because of the content created by people like you and me. If we stop creating content for them (slave labor), there's less to look at. 

And if we stop looking at them, they don't make money. 

It's that simple. Twitter and Facebook make money and gain illicit power because you let them. Because you can't help yourself. Because you enjoy seeing what others have posted for free.

### Looking at Twitter or Facebook Is Like Donating to Nazi Germany or Imperial Japan

I get the attraction, but it's un-American. It's morally worse than buying German or Japanese products during World War II. 

Buying an enemy-made product during a war is sinful and treasonous. But it's also less damaging than assisting the enemy's war effort directly. 

When you provide content to Facebook or Twitter, you might as well be providing ammunition to the Nazi sniper who has your great uncle's head in his crosshairs. Posting content to those wretched systems is feeding them free ammunition.

### War Demands Sacrifice from Everyone

We are in a war. Shots have been fired. POWs have been taken. (Kyle Rittenhouse?) It's too late to hope something changes. It's time to be the change. 

If you're over 30, Twitter and Facebook didn't exist for most of your life. They didn't exist on 9/11/2001 (but more than 50 percent of people remember seeing the news first on Facebook or Twitter.) America is nearly 250 years old.

(Warning: [We are Digital Nomads and might have to move again](https://hennessysview.com/digital-nomads/).) 

If you and our country survived that long without them, walking away won't hurt that much. 

**Find a new way to keep in touch with friends and family**. Try calling them or writing a letter. Or an email. Create a Telegram group. 

Or, better yet, tell them you won't use communist tools like Twitter or Facebook. **If they want to engage with you on social media, they need to sign up for Parler and MeWe**.

### Parler and MeWe are Superior to Twitter and Facebook in Every Important Way

Parler and MeWee protect your privacy and information, while Twitter and Facebook sell your most intimate moments to companies and foreign agents. 

Parler and MeWe protect your First Amendment rights, while Twitter and Facebook are using money you give them to abolish the First Amendment (and the second). 

Parler and MeWe love America while Twitter and Facebook actively work for America's downfall. 

If you look at Twitter or Facebook, you're funding the conspiracy to destroy, you're own country. What does that make you?

### Follow Me to Parler and MeWee

You won't find new posts from me on Twitter or Facebook. I've turned over my group pages to others. Twitter has banned me, so I can't delete my account. I will delete my Facebook accounts over the weekend. (I have to get my photos.)

**Consider using this prolonged weekend to downloading the things you need from those platforms and, Sunday night, deleting your accounts**. Here's how:

**How to Permanently Delete Your Twitter Account**

- Open Twitter in a web browser and log in. You cannot delete your Twitter account on Twitter’s app – you must do it through a browser.
- Click on your profile image and then click the ‘Settings’ button to take you to the settings page.
- Select ‘Settings and Privacy,’ and then click ‘Deactivate my account.’
- Click ‘Deactivate @username,’ and then re-enter your Twitter password. This helps Twitter confirm it is definitely you, and prevents your account being deleted as a prank or even as an accident.
- Wait for the 30 days to pass, and your account will be deleted.
