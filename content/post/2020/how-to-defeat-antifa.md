I recently read [the account of a Marine Corps veteran who traveled to Portland, Oregon, seeking a job as a Portland police officer](https://www.americanpartisan.org/2020/09/antifa-reality-check/). Along with two other combat veterans trained in urban warfare, this Marine, with permission from the Portland Police Department, decided to witness the nightly siege of Portland by Antifa and BLM activists. 

His harrowing account can be summed as: **don't go there**. 

Antifa is better trained than any enemy we've faced in Iraq or Afghanistan. Antifa's command and control structure is superior to those of the Portland Police, the US Marine Corps, or the NSA. Their tactics render our best-trained urban warfare experts impotent and affraid. 

In short, Antifa sent these three Marines running scared for 11 blocks. And the Marines came armed, locked, and loaded. The Marine's sobering conclusion:

> Bottom line: don’t go to an Antifa protest where you can put yourself in that situation. And if you find yourself in that situation, expect them to employ tactics that take away your situational awareness, and complicate the use of force continuum.

In a recent [guest-post on The Gateway Pundit](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/09/demonic-possession-portland-riots/?utm_source=Twitter&utm_campaign=websitesharingbuttons), I argue that the army needed to defeat Antifa is not the US Marine Corps or the Army or even the Portland Police Deparment. We can defeat Antifa, but not in physical battle. 

As I see it, Antifa is not an army of malcontents, but an army of the demonically oppressed and possessed. Their superior command and control is superior because it is preturnatural. Fallen spirits direct Antifa's actions and provide information "enemy" movement and intentions that are not humanly knowable. Attemtping to fight Antifa with human means is a surefire way too lose. 

Defeating Antifa requires that we drop our man-made weapons and tactics and put on the full armor of God. And, for Catholics, that begins with shielding our thoughts and intentions from demonic surveillance. 

Exorcists and Catholic demonologists who assist in solemn exorcism under the direction of bishop tell us that demons use our sins as weapons against us. Mortal sin opens our entire lives to satanic surveillance, the way bad software exposes our keystrokes to hackers. We can close this wormhole only through a perfect sacramental Confession and absolution. 

By confessing all of our sins, we deprive demons of their greatest weapon: access to read our thoughts, our fears, our secrets, our souls. We blind them and cut off their interactions with us and with each other. 

Sin, my friends, is the Devil's wormhole.

After sacramental confession, we can begin to fight in earnest. 

While we cannot directly order demons to cease and desist in Portland, we can call on angels and saints and God Almighty—Father, Son, and Holy Ghost—to subdue demonic activity, even far away in Portland, Oregon. 

(Note: A person in a state of grace *can* bind and expel demons from people and places over which he has lawful authority. But do not try this at home without guidance from a priest. Don't mess with demons directly. I recommend reading Fr. Chad Ripperger's [*Deliverance Prayers: for use by the laity*](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B01N5IDAPA&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_ArcwFb3P2XERE) and Adam C. Blei's [*Hauntings, Possessions, and Exorcisms*](https://read.amazon.com/kp/embed?asin=B075W79V5H&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_KqcwFbQXVYKFM) for more information.)

In His mercy, Christ, through His Church, has given us spiritual combat prayers to use in our battle with powers and principalities. Make these words of the Apostle Paul your daily reading:

> Finally, brethren, be strengthened in the Lord, and in the might of his power. Put you on the armour of God, that you may be able to stand against the deceits of the devil. For our wrestling is not against flesh and blood; but against principalities and power, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in the high places. Therefore take unto you the armour of God, that you may be able to resist in the evil day, and to stand in all things perfect. Stand therefore, having your loins girt about with truth, and having on the breastplate of justice, And your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace: In all things taking the shield of faith, wherewith you may be able to extinguish all the fiery darts of the most wicked one. And take unto you the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit (which is the word of God).

Pray five decades of the Rosary every day. Our Blessed Mother gave us the Rosary for spiritual combat. St. Padre Pio, when challenged by demons, would call out, "**Bring me my weapon!**" referring to the Most Holy Rosary. Fr. Jose Maria Escriva said, "**The holy Rosary is a powerful weapon**. Use it with confidence and you will be amazed at the results."

The [website Michael describes](https://www.michaeljournal.org/articles/roman-catholic-church/item/the-rosary-a-powerful-weapon-against-the-devil) Satan's hatred of the Rosary:

> One day a colleague of mine heard the devil say during an exorcism: "Every Hail Mary is like a blow on my head. If Christians knew how powerful the Rosary was, it would be my end." The secret that makes this prayer so effective is that the Rosary is both prayer and meditation. It is addressed to the Father, to the Blessed Virgin, and to the Holy Trinity, and is a meditation centred on Christ.

After Confession, make the Rosary your daily battle plan against the demons afflicting America. But we can't stop there, for God does not favor nations that turn away from His love.

Finally, we must work tirelessly to restore God as our head of state by advancing the [Social Kingship of Christ](https://onepeterfive.com/just-hearts-true-social-kingship-christ/). 

The Social Kingship of Christ means that we are all primarily Christ's subjects and secondarily Americans. Faith before nationality. 

That's not to say we don't owe our nation our loyalty and patriotism. We do. And part of that patriotism requires us that we keep our country in good standing with our Creator, the source of our life, liberty, and happiness. Without God, we are a lost tribe in constant conflict amongst ourselves and against other nations. With God, we are at peace in our hearts and in our communities. 

That means we demand our politicians put God first and do their best to make law according to God's will, not ours. 

The way to defeat Antifa, then is simple and within your power:

1. Go to Confession and remain in a state of grace.
2. Pray the Rosary every day. 
3. Make America Holy Again.

If we do these things, Antifa doesn't stand a chance. If we don't, we don't.
