The Commission on Presidential Debates, a partisan, anti-Trump cabal, may have just boosted Trump's victory margin by trying to cheat.

The Trump Train seems to be in a tizzy over the Commission's new rules and changes to topics for the second presidential debate. The rule change involved cutting the microphone of one party while the other party speaks. The topic change was to drop foreign policy because Trump has been nominated for so many Nobel Peace Prizes that the Commission considers even mentioning the topic unfair. 

These changes, announced just days before Thursday's final debate, sent me and many others to social media to scream "unfair!" 

But, maybe we shouldn't be upset. Come Friday morning, we might be thanking the Commission for giving Trump an unfair advantage in Thursday's debate between Trump and crooked Joe the Bribe King.

### Never Trump as Wile E. Coyote

Since Trump took the magical escalator ride to the lobby of Trump Tower in 2015, his enemies have tried to defeat him by cheating. First, the Republican National Committee rigged everything against him. The neo-conservatives used their Deep State tools to undermine him. The media accused him of being "literally Hitler" almost daily. 

Once Trump became the nominee, anti-Trump forces on stepped up their nefarious attacks, schemes, plans, and capers. They tried everything from planting CIA and FBI spies in his organization to tapping his phones, to buying a fake dossier from a Russian agent. 

After his election and inauguration, the left and its Republican cabana boys tried everything, legal and illegal, licit and illicit, to keep America from becoming great again. Former Speaker Paul Ryan refused to enact the president's agenda, leaked classified and confidential information, and sided with the leftist media against the president. 

Of course, we all know about the fraudulent Mueller investigation, the crimes of Jim Comey, the fake Ukraine scandal, and everything else the left and Republican warhawks tried to bring Trump down.

And what did Trump do? Trump just kept on winning. 

In fact, almost every crooked plot against Trump blew up in his enemies' faces like a Wile E. Coyote plot with an Acme product. A list of anti-Trump backfires reads like Wile E. Coyote's list of mishaps with Acme products in [the classic parody piece, Coyote v. Acme](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/1990/02/26/coyote-v-acme):

> Mr. Coyote states that on occasions too numerous to list in this document he has suffered mishaps with explosives purchased of Defendant: the Acme “Little Giant” Firecracker, the Acme Self-Guided Aerial Bomb, etc. (For a full listing, see the Acme Mail Order Explosives Catalogue and attached deposition, entered in evidence as Exhibit C.) Indeed, it is safe to say that not once has an explosive purchased of Defendant by Mr. Coyote performed in an expected manner. To cite just one example: At the expense of much time and personal effort, Mr. Coyote constructed around the outer rim of a butte a wooden trough beginning at the top of the butte and spiralling downward around it to some few feet above a black X painted on the desert floor. The trough was designed in such a way that a spherical explosive of the type sold by Defendant would roll easily and swiftly down to the point of detonation indicated by the X. Mr. Coyote placed a generous pile of birdseed directly on the X, and then, carrying the spherical Acme Bomb (Catalogue # 78-832), climbed to the top of the butte. Mr. Coyote’s prey, seeing the birdseed, approached, and Mr. Coyote proceeded to light the fuse. In an instant, the fuse burned down to the stem, causing the bomb to detonate.
> In addition to reducing all Mr. Coyote’s careful preparations to naught, the premature detonation of Defendant’s product resulted in the following disfigurements to Mr. Coyote:
> 
> 1. Severe singeing of the hair on the head, neck, and muzzle.
> 
> 2. Sooty discoloration.
> 
> 3. Fracture of the left ear at the stem, causing the ear to dangle in the aftershock with a creaking noise.
> 
> 4. Full or partial combustion of whiskers, producing kinking, frazzling, and ashy disintegration.
> 
> 5. Radical widening of the eyes, due to brow and lid charring.

### Space for Rent in Joe's Head

Adam Schiff has played the role of Professor Coyote in the past, but the Debate Commission might have stepped into the spotlight this time. Here's why:

1. Joe Biden is mentally incompetent. Everybody knows this. Trump-friendly Republicans said after Debate 1 that Trump probably should have interrupted Biden less because Biden was always on the verge of going off the rails like a crazy train. By silencing Biden's microphone, the American people will be subjected to Biden's defects in uninterrupted two-minute intervals. 
3. The rules changes give Trump another example of election interference and rigging, and people don't like unfairness. 
4. But the main reason the Commission's plot could blow up in its face is this: **Trump can interrupt Biden's mind without interrupting Biden**. Some people (women) found Trump's berating of Biden mean in Debate 1. Because they could *hear* Trump talking over Biden. With Trump's mic off, the President can jabber at Biden the whole time Sleepy Joe is rambling, but folks at home won't hear him. Only Biden will hear Trump creeping around in his brain, dropping trigger words like "laptop," and "Hunter," and "Burisma," and "bribery," and "low IQ." And there's nothing Biden or the moderator can do it about without interrupting Biden. 

When you see Biden changing subjects multiple times during his "uninterrupted" two minutes of blather, you'll know that Donald Trump has taken up some very expensive real estate in Biden's vacant head.
