One of the most despicable men alive, ABC News White House reporter Jon Karl, took his shot a Pulitzer for online journalism today by snitching on Fox News' John Roberts. 

Roberts, aparently, was the last person outdoors in the Rose Garden, to put on his mask. 

Look a "Karen" Karl's snotty tweet:

Jon Karl was the kid who made sure the teacher didn't forget to collect homework. What a pantywaste. 

Dan Bongino jumped on Karl immediately.

John Roberts fired back, too.

And Sara Carter.

Now we know what a loser scum Jon Karl is.
