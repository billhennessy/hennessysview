Releasing national security intercepts to unauthorized persons is a federal felony punishable by 10 years in prison. And at least one of the names on this list of top Obama Administration officials is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. [18 U.S. Code § 798(a)(4)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/798):


> Whoever knowingly and willfully communicates, furnishes, transmits, or otherwise makes available to an unauthorized person, or publishes, or uses in any manner prejudicial to the safety or interest of the United States or for the benefit of any foreign government to the detriment of the United States any classified information—obtained by the processes of communication intelligence from the communications of any foreign government, knowing the same to have been obtained by such processes—Shall be fined under this title or **imprisoned not more than ten years**, or both.

This happened. Conversations subject to this law were released without lawful authority to the New York Times and the Washington Post by one or more of the persons listed below:

| Suspect | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Joe Biden | Vice President of the United States |
| Denis McDonough | Chief of Staff to President Obama |
| John Brennan | Director of Central Intelligence |
| James Clapper | Director National Security |

| Susan Rice | National Security Advisor |
| Samantha Power | US Ambassador to the United Nations |
| Michael Dempsey | Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Intelligence Integration |
| Stephanie L. O'Sullivan | Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence |
| John R. Phillips | US Ambassador to Italy |
| Patrick Conlon | Office of Management Director |
| Jacob Lew | Secretary of the Treasury |
| Arthur "Danny" McGlynn | Acting Assistant Secretary of the Treasury |
| Mike Neufeld | Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury |
| Sarah Raskin | Deputy Secretary of the Treasury |

| REDACTED | CMO |
| REDACTED | DCOS |
| John Tefft | US Amabassador to Russia |
| REDACTED | CMO |
| Ambassador Bass | US Ambassador to Turkey |
| REDACTED | CIA/CTMC |

Every person on this list is a felony suspect and should be treated as such by everyone. 

### Someone (or more) Leaked the Flynn Call to the New York Times

We know that the New York Times received details of the Flynn call to Russian Amb. Kislyak from one of the people on this list. One or more. 

We know that leaking intercepted communications "obtained by the processes of communication intelligence from the communications of any foreign government" is a felony punishable by 10 years in federal prison. 

And we know that Joe Biden, the Democrat nominee for President of the United States is one of the suspects of this felony. 

### And the Entire Deep State Is Circling the Wagons

Judge Emmett Sullivan is creating precedent faster than the Marshall Supreme Court. 

Yesterday, he effectively rejected the DOJ's dropping of charges against General Mike Flynn. The DOJ dropped charged because the DOJ, by its own admission, conducted a blackmail operation against Flynn and his son for the purpose of toppling the duly elected president. 

The Department of of Justice attempted a coup. It got caught. It dropped charges. And Emmett "Scum" Sullivan, a profane and prejudiced judge, rejected the DOJ's admission of guilt. 

{{< figure src="/images/sullivan-scum.jpg" caption="" title="Judge Emmett Sullivan" link="" >}}

Today, "Judge" Sullivan asked a retired Clinton-appointed judge to represent the Department of Justice *ad litem* in order to build a new case against General Flynn. 

This has never happened in American history. A department of the US government is being represented by an enemy at the order of a rogue judge.

America is done. 

### Give Up on the Law

There is no political-science evidence that the rule of law or the legal system still exists in the United States. Almost every senior member of the Obama administration spied on General Michael Flynn for political purposes. That is undeniable. 

The FBI and the Department of Justice, under President Obama, conducted an illegal spy and propaganda operation against the duly-elected president for the purposes of overthrowing the government. This, too, is undeniable. 

A federal judge is refusing to accept a prosecutor's admission of prosecutorial misconduct in order to please his political masters. Also undeniable. 

We refrain from open rebellion why?
