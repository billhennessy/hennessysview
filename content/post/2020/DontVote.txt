We couldn't. 

It's time to stop voting. It's time to exit politics until Republicans start fighting for the republic or [the United States are broken up into three independent countries](https://hennessysview.com/the-end-of-america/). 

Republicans seem to have thrown in the towel. Not on Trump, but on the republic itself. 

And I am throwing in the towel on Republicans. And on voting. Republicans have let me down for the last time. **I now believe it's wrong to vote in America** until the election system is fixed and guaranteed free from fraud. Good people can't vote and remain good people. Thank Bill Barr and Lindsey Graham. 

Attorney Lin Wood gets it. Here he is addressing a massive #StopTheSteal rally in Georgia today:

I agree completely with Lin Wood. If Georgia doesn't fix its system, no one should vote. Just don't vote, people. Just don't vote. 

As long as you keep voting, Republicans will keep letting you down. Every Georgian who votes on January 5 will be endorsing stolen elections and a stolen country. They will be voting for private government. 

No more. Voting in a corrupt system is an endorsement of that corrupt system. 

"But, Bill," you say. If we don't vote, we can't win." 

Seriously? If you *do* vote you can't win. You can't win a rigged game. And every election is or can be rigged. And every election of consequence will be rigged. 

"But, Bill, if you don't vote, we could lose the Senate."

We've already lost the Senate, folks. The Georgia runoff is just as rigged as the Georgia presidential election. If the Masters of the Universe who decide our elections have the nerve to steal a presidential election, do you really think they'll hesitate to steal a Senate runoff? 

Look at their incentives: if they get the Senate, and if the November 3 election stands, **they will own the country** lock, stock, and barrel. 

They'll pack the Supreme Court. They'll admit Puerto Rico and DC as leftist states. They'll eliminate the filibuster. They'll outlaw gun ownership. They'll open the borders. They'll outlaw home schooling and charter schools and, likely, parochial schools. They'll ban oil extraction. 

They'll do whatever they damn well please. 

With enough upside, people will commit any crime. And the upside for Democrats in stealing the Senate is enormous! It's the biggest upside since Alexander the Great. 

What kind of an idiot do you take me for? You really think you can get more Republicans to vote in Georgia than Democrats can print ballots? You insult me.

If the November election stands, [Democrats will never stop cheating](https://hennessysview.com/ask-not-for-money/). And, as long they cheat, your vote only endorses the fraud. As P.J. O'Rourke put it: *Don't Vote. It Just Encourages the Bastards*.

**Until Republicans fight as hard for fair elections as Marines fought for Iwo Jima, I will not vote.** Nor will I donate to any cause or candidate at any level. Nor will I promote any candidate. 

What I will do is encourage people to boycott elections, like I'm doing right now. All elections. Just refuse. No donations, no yard signs, and no votes. I will continue to make the argument that participating in a rigged election that you know to be rigged is morally repugnant and scandalous.

When Republicans man-up and use every means at their disposal to guarantee free elections, even at the cost of their careers or lives, I will vote again. But time is running out. 

If this election stands, the window to fix the election system closes. Democrats will never give up absolute power except by force and arms. It's now, never, or war. Fight now, live as a slave, or die in the fight to reclaim freedom. 

If this election stands, the American experiment is over. And I won't vote in a foreign election.
