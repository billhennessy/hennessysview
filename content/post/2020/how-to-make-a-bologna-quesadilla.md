It seems like the *only* food in the house on Thanksgiving Day is Thanksgiving food. And that's not available before 3:00. 

(Let's be real. Thanksgiving dinner is *planned* for 3:00. In reality, the turkey's not done. And whoever brought the mashed potatoes let them get ice cold on the drive over. And someone forgot all about the damn rolls. We actually say the *Benedic Domine* about 5:27, after the turkey, which "popped" at 3:57, has had time to cool off and dry out.) 

About 11:30 a.m., I realized I needed to eat something. So I wandered into the kitchen to look. 

Nada. 

Lot's of stuff for dinner, but not a logical thing for lunch. Bologna, but no keto bread. A box of fully cooked bacon with no bacon in it. (But someone thoughtfully put it back in the refrigerator.) Condiments, of course. 

So I invented the bologna quesadilla. 

Here's how. 

### Ingredients

2-3 thick slices of excellent beef bologna
1 handful of shredded cheddar cheese
1 low-carb tortilla 
Mustard

### Directions

Squeeze some mustard on the tortilla. Slap the bologna onto the mustarded tortilla. Sprinkle cheese on the bologna.

With the oven already on 350-degrees to cook the turkey, slid the concoction on the top rack and close the oven.

When the cheese I melt and before the shell get too stiff (about 3 minutes), fold it in half and let bake another 3-4 minutes until cheese is runny.

Remove from oven. Let cool a minute. (The tortilla will be *muy caliente*. 

### Conclusion

When there's nothing "normal" to eat for lunch on Thanksgiving while you're waiting for dinner, it's a perfect time to invent something fascinating and new. 

Happy Thanksgiving.
