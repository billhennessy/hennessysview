### Netflix Distributes Child Pornography

According to federal law, child pornography refers to any kind of visual depiction that displays sexually explicit conduct that involves individuals who are under the age of 18 (source: Bartlby). 

If you want to reference the actual law, it's 18 U.S. Code § 2252:

> (a)(2)(A) the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.

A new Netflix series, which I have seen only in clips on social media, seems to fit that definition of child porn like a glove. 

Clips from the program show girls reportedly as young as 11 working as strippers in a club. Dancing and twerking. (We’re not going to post any videos or photos from Cuties, because that would be distributing child pornography. And that’s a crime.) 

People who’ve seen the show (which constitutes receiving child pornography) say the show includes even more sexually explicit child porn than the clips and trailers.

It’s not surprising that Netflix, which is run by famous Democrats like Barack Obama and Susan Rice, would try to normalize child porn, pedophilia, and pederasty. Prominent Democrats seem particularly drawn to sex with children. [California’s legislature recently reduced penalties for adults who have “consenting” sex with children](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-bill-lower-penalties-sexual-relations-with-minor-newsom). 

Clinton pal Jeffrey Epstein (didn’t kill himself) ran a child-sex ring, kept sex slaves, and brought Bill Clinton and many other prominent Democrats to a child-sex island in the Caribbean. And Joe Biden likes it when little kids play with hair on his legs in the pool. Sex with minors seems to be a common practice among prominent Democrats. 

People who become aware of child pornography have an obligation to report it. Here’s how, from the Department of Justice:

> Child Pornography
> •	To report an incident involving the possession, distribution, receipt, or production of child pornography, file a report on the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC)'s website at [www.cybertipline.com](http://www.cybertipline.com/), or call 1-800-843-5678. Your report will be forwarded to a law enforcement agency for investigation and action.
> •	You may also wish to report the incident to federal, state, or local law enforcement personnel.

If you’ve seen the Netflix how Cuties, consider filing a complaint with the National Center for Missing & Exploited children, for your own protection if nothing else. Should the DoJ charge Netflix with producing and distributing child pornography, records of who’s watched the show will likely be considered.
