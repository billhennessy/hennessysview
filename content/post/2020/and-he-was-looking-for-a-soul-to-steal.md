The Bible has one overarching message: do things God's way, and things work out; do things your way, and everything goes to hell.

C.S. Lewis summarized it this way: 

> There are two kinds of people in this world: those who say to God, "Thy will be done," and those to whom God says, "Alright, then, have it your way." 

The Old Testament (or the Jewish Bible) is a repetition of this this simple rule over and over again. Does God not tell Adam and Eve, "Alright, then, have it your way?" Doesn't Elijah exhort people, including kings, that if they do things their way instead of God's way disaster will happen? In fact, isn't that pretty much what all there prophets say? 

There's a popular joke that goes something like, "if you want to make God laugh, tell Him your plans."

It seems that humans are little more than dogs who can communicate with spiritual beings. We can communicate with angels and the Holy Trinity, of course. But we can also communicate with demons just as readily. And they can communicate with us. They have. They do. 

I'm not talking about schizophrenics who hear voices. I'm talking about healthy adults. Though angels and demons do not converse through our physical senses, they converse with us, nonetheless. We all know it, even though we deny it. (I suspect that the most oft repeated phrase from demons to people is, "you are not hearing this because I don't exist.") 

When you watch the video of George Floyd's hideous murder at the hands and knee of Derek Chauvin, look at Chauvin. Who is he taking direction from? 

I hate to post this sickening video. If you haven't watched the entirety, please do. It's an important moment in history, but not for the reasons you might be thinking.

From whom was Derek Chauvin taking direction? Who ordered Chauvin to kneel on George Floyd's throat for eight minutes and forty-six seconds? 

### Suspending the First Amendment

Beginning about March 6, cities and states in the United States began suspending the First Amendment to the Constitution. One of the first rights to be suspended was the right to free exercise of religion. 

While many Protestants and Jews defied or, at least, objected to the unconstitutional abridgment of the right to exercise religion, the Catholic Church in America, through the US Conference of Catholic Bishops, quickly prohibited public Masses. Most mainline Protestant churches complied, though reluctantly, complied with state and local executive orders to suspend public worship. 

The few Protestant congregations who defied these unconstitutional executive orders were famously arrested or fined. 

Beginning on or about March 6, America told God to get lost. 

And He did. "Alright, then, have it your way." 

### Man Has No Thoughts of His Own

*Cogito, ergo sum*

I think, therefore, I am.

Wrong. 

Man doesn't "think." Man is a beast like dog or lizard. Man has three "thoughts": food, sex, survival. Like dog.

Left to his own devices, man will behave like an animal. But man is never left to his own devices. Man is in constant communication with spiritual beings. From these spiritual beings, man acquires what we think of as thought. Ideas. 

Ideas are not ours. They come from either God, often transmitted through angels or saints, or from Satan, often transmitted through other demons. The idea for *Crime and Punishment* probably came from an angel. The idea for *Naked Lunch* almost certainly came from a demon. 

Great monuments are inspired, designed, and built for and by God or Satan. The Great Temple was God's idea; the Great Pyramid Satan's. Man is simply a robot doing God's will or God's enemy's will. 

### God Respects Us; Satan Doesn't

When we tell God to shut up and go away, He does. He respects the free will He gave us. He's always willing to be friends again, but He won't force His friendship upon us. 

Satan, on the other hand, has no respect for humans. When we tell the devil to shut up and go away, he simply takes on another form. How many people do you know who gave up drinking only to take up cigarettes? 

When we stop talking to God, Satan's voice hits us uninterrupted. Those who consider God's voice noise can squelch Him out, leaving only a crystal clear signal from the evil one. 

On or about March 6, America turned Satan's signal into a 100,000 watt, clear channel radio station beamed into the heart of every man and woman in the country. 

And the devil didn't whiff. The devil never whiffs.

### Derek Chauvin and Antifa

I know very little about Derek Chauvin. I know what I saw in the video. I've read that he has had about a dozen complaints of excess force in his 20-year career. I know that his wife is a real estate agent, and, legally, they both live in Florida. 

I suspect that Derek Chauvin and Antifa both report to the same commander. (I'm using Antifa as a catch-all for those who used George Floyd's murder as an excuse to destroy things and hurt or kill people.)

Something directed Chauvin to kneel on George Floyd's throat. Something used Chauvin's willing cooperation with that evil directive to convince mobs to loot, burn, steal, beat, murder, and destroy in apparent retaliation. 

I argue that it was a single something: Satan. The prince of this world. Chauvin and Antifa are related as
