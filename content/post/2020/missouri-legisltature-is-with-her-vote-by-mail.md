I got a distraught email from a dear friend whose life's work has been protecting the ballot box. 

> Bill, we have got to do something about this. The Missouri Legislature today in their final session approved Mail-In Voting for the next 2 elections including the Presidential election because of precautions of the Corona virus. This was supported by the Republican State Committee. [Secretary of State] Jay [Ashcroft] was totally opposed to this unless the [sic] also approved a voter ID which they dropped from the final bill.

> Why are we voting for Republicans anymore I wonder.

> This cannot stand. I think it is time for another TeaParty Movement. 

She's referring to SB-552, passed on the last day of the 2020 Missouri legislative session. The bill allows for absentee ballots for anyone afraid of the Coronavirus. 

I talked to a Missouri legislator about why Republicans voted for this bill. But, first, let's look at the dangers of mail-in voting.

### Mail-In Voting Guarantees Rampant Fraud and Stolen Elections

Freida Keough and Judy Sofka run [the Missouri Precinct Project](https://www.facebook.com/Missouri-Precinct-Project-MOPP-103820183051754/?ref=page_internal), an organization that has fought tirelessly for decades to eliminate vote fraud and keep elections clean and fair. 

Freida and Judy were first-wave Tea Partier back in 2009, and they haven't slowed down their fight to clean up Missouri's voter rolls, demand voter ID legislation, and staff polling places with judges who will prevent fraud. 

For Freida Keough and Judy Sofka, the champions of clean elections, this bill felt like a slap in the face. Here's why: mail-in voting is a recipe for stolen elections.

Tom Fitton, head of Judicial Watch, told Tucker Carlson why mail-in voting is so dangerous to our republic recently:

### What SB-552 Allows

The biggest complaint about SB-552 is that legislators stripped language requiring positive, photo id to vote. That change prompted Missouri's Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft to oppose the legislation. 

The bill does require mail-in voters to certify that they are who they say they and that they'll only vote once. Because people bent on stuffing the ballot box would never lie on a form. 

Further, though some media reports claim the bill limits voting by mail to persons over 65 years of age, I cannot find that restriction anywhere in the legislation. Here is the pertinent part of the bill:

> Any covered voter, as defined in section 115.275, who is eligible to register and vote
>  in this state may vote in any election for federal office, statewide office, state legislative office,
>  or statewide ballot initiatives by submitting a federal postcard application to apply to vote by
>  absentee ballot or by submitting a federal postcard application at the polling place even though
>  the person is not registered. A federal postcard application submitted by a covered voter
>  pursuant to this subsection shall also serve as a voter registration application under section
>  115.908 and the election authority shall, if satisfied that the applicant is entitled to register, place
>  the voter's name on the voter registration file. **Each covered voter may vote by absentee ballot
>  or, upon submitting an affidavit that the person is qualified to vote in the election, may vote at
>  the person's polling place**.

(Section 115.275 does not include any age restrictions on absentee voting.)

Later, we find the new reason for voting absentee, again with no age requirement:

> the risk of contracting or transmitting severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus during an election held during a state of emergency, declared by the governor, in the year 2020.

So, why would Republicans vote for this bill? 

### Why Republicans Voted For the Bill

A member of the Missouri House Republican Caucus says the legislature had no choice but to pass this bill. Without it, the ACLU would have sued for vote-by-mail, and the ACLU would have won. 

Additionally, the legislator points out:

1. The bill does not permit voting by mail. It just adds an additional reason for voting absentee: fear of Coronavirus.
2. Absentee voters must still get their ballot notarized, which is why most Democrats voted against the bill.
3. The bill expires at the end of 2020 or when the state of emergency is rescinded, whichever comes first.

"It sucks," the legislator said, "but it's better than the alternative." 

Clean election proponents would likely differ on a few points. 

First, there's no guarantee the ACLU's lawsuit would prevail. If the ACLU were certain of prevailing, they'd pursue the suit, anyway, since the SB-552 does not go as far as their suit requests. In other words, we might still get vote-by-mail from judicial activism, but we lost our ability to claim we're against it. Besides, when did Republicans start caving under threat of a ACLU suit? 

Second, opponents of the Coronavirus lockdown have made solid arguments that Coronavirus is similar to the season flu in prevalence and mortality. Why wouldn't the ACLU threaten to file the same suit next year, substituting influenza for Coronavirus? Or, if, as many experts believe, Coronavirus becomes just another seasonal virus, why wouldn't this provision be required in future years? We always vote in April and November, months within the cold and flu season. 

Considering everything, it's understandable why Republicans would take a lesser-of-two-evils approach in hopes of avoiding a more dangerous mail-in rule handed down by an Obama-appointed judge. On the other hand, it's only natural for proponents of fraud-free elections to be upset. 

### Ask Governor Parson to Veto SB-552

If you're opposed to SB-552 after all this, the last line of defense against SB-552 is a veto by the governor. 

Governor Parson opposed expanding absentee voting earlier this year, and I can find no evidence he's changed his mind. A veto will, at least, give a fighting chance at killing this legislation.
