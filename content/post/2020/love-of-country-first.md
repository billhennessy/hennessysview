We have been lied to since 1960. 

Everyone knows Richard Nixon beat John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential race. Kennedy "won" because of election fraud in Illinois and Texas. Everyone knows that, too. 

Nixon decided to let it go. He didn't contest Illinois on the advice of people like George Romney and Prescott Bush. "Be the bigger man," they told Nixon. "Put the country first."

Romney and Bush were lying, of course. Nixon's refusal to contest Illinois was an act of pure selfishness. He didn't want to damage his political future by getting into a street fight with the Democrats. He wanted to live to fight another day.

It's a lie to say that conceding in a fraudulent election puts the country first. Conceding to fraud is consenting to fraud. It is fraud. 

By conceding, Nixon put his political career before the integrity of the republic. Nixon had both moral and patriotic duties to demand an honest election. He, instead, endorsed the lie and the fraud of the 1960 election. Nixon became an accessory after the fact to a massive election fraud.  

Recently, Catholic Bishop Richard Stika of Knoxville, TN, (and native of St. Louis) perpetuated the lie that there's honor in participating in a fraud. Stika tweeted:

Stika here makes a common error, conflating lack of conflict with peace. The exact same error led Neville Chamberlain to appease Hitler. 

Donald Trump is a patriot. He puts the integrity of America's political system before his own self interest. Trump could go back to living like a billionaire in retirement, his exceedingly able kids running his real estate empire while he stumps at rallies before tens of thousands of *paying* fans. (Those tickets would be expensive.)

But Trump is doing what patriots do: sacrificing his time and treasure for the American people, half of whom hate his guts. Trump doesn't care. He does what's right. He fights when duty calls. 

If believe in self-governance, you must support Trump's fight for free and honest elections. Otherwise, you're just a selfish politician doing what's best for you.
