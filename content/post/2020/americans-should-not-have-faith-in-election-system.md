Until the fraud of 2020 is exposed, prosecuted, and its results expunged, Americans must assume every election is corrupt. Every election at every level. Nothing can be trusted. 

Some say we must have faith in the integrity of elections. This statement is a neuro-linguistic programming command to override the conscious mind and embed a "belief" that elections have integrity. It implies some defect in those who do not have faith in the American election system. It is a lie. 

You should not have faith in a rigged election system anymore than you should have faith in a defective bridge. 

* Pennsylvania sent out 1.8 million mail-in ballots but counted 2.5 mail-in ballot returns. Distrust Pennsylvania.
* Michigan had a dozen with more votes than people. Distrust Michigan. 
* Wisconsin counted hundreds of thousands of ballots in boxes exclusively for Biden (no other candidate in any races) that magically appeared at 4:00 a.m. Distrust Wisconsin. 
* Georgia produced hundreds of thousands of Biden votes while vote-counting was stopped because of a water-main break that never happened. Distrust Georgia. 
* All four states, plus Arizona and Nevada, claimed to have stopped counting at the same time on election night. Distrust them all. 

Trust is earned, never owed, even to God. (God earned our trust by creating us, loving us, becoming one of us, and dying for our sins.) An American who trusts the election system is either a fool or a crook. The fools do what they're told; the crooks use the system to obtain what is not rightfully theirs. 

The American election system is a fraud at its core. Distrust the American election system. Distrust people associated with elections. Distrust people who tell you to have faith in the system. 

The system is rigged. We elected Trump to unrig it. If he can't, there will never again be an American election worth your time or energy. 

Put your energy into two things:

1. Harassing and interfering with government at all levels to force a reboot. Cooperation with evil is evil.
2. Preparing for massive societal upheavalâ€”physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. You won't know the day nor the hour.

> Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to send peace, but a sword. (Matthew 10:34)
