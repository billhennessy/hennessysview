Anarchy. Chaos. Bedlam. War zone. Out of control. 

That's how reporters on the streets described New York last night. Looters struck almost every business from 60th Street to 14th Street from 3rd Avenue to 6th Avenue. The heart of Midtown Manhattan was destroyed. 

Closer to home, peaceful protestors shot four St. Louis police officers. They set a 7-11 ablaze, then blocked the path of fire trucks. Chances are, this was a test run for a larger attack, perhaps on a police station. 

The 2020 Riots are just vastest assault on America. Seemingly forgot amidst the guerrilla war of this past week is the Coronavirus pandemic and our leaders' responses. Big city and county leaders ordered just about all small businesses closed indefinitely. In Missouri, the leaders of St. Louis County and City strong-armed a Republican governor into keeping the state in a perpetual state of lockdown. 

Combined, the pandemic response and the riots have put entrepreneurs on notice. While big chains continued to operate, small shops suffer. Business insurance covers neither pandemics nor riots. Government aid isn't enough to cover wages, rent, and other costs of running a business.
