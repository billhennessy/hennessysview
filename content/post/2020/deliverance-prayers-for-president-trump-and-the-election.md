The children of darkness seek to steal the United States for as a gift for their evil father. 

([Please share on Parler](https://parler.com/new-post?message=https://hennessysview.com/deliverance-prayers-for-president-trump-and-the-election))

Archbishop Viganó, former Papal Nuncio to the United States, has described the 2020 presidential election as "**the most colossal electoral fraud in history**." And he warned us to recognize what we are up against in [his open letter to America](https://www.lifesitenews.com/opinion/vigano-america-is-in-midst-of-colossal-electoral-fraud-we-must-pray-now-to-defeat-enemy):

> Do not think that the children of darkness act with honesty, and do not be scandalized if they operate with deception. Do you perhaps believe that Satan’s followers are honest, sincere, and loyal? The Lord has warned us against the Devil: “He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in truth, because there is no truth in him. When he tells a lie, he speaks in character, because he is a liar and the father of lies” (Jn 8:44).

Then, The [Gateway Pundit reported](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/11/catholic-exorcist-fr-chad-ripperger-calls-faithful-recite-prayer-bind-evil-spirits-satanic-forces-election-oddities-resolved/) that one of the leading exorcists in the United States, Father Chad Ripperger, urged Catholics to pray this deliverance prayer for the election, to call on the Precious Blood of Jesus Christ to drive the demons from the election process:

> In His Name and by the power of His Cross and Blood, I ask Jesus to bind any evil spirits, forces and powers of the earth, air, fire, or water, of the netherworld and the satanic forces of nature. By the power of the Holy Spirit and by His authority, I ask Jesus Christ to break any curses, hexes, or spells and send them back to where they came from, if it be His Holy Will. I beseech Thee Lord Jesus to protect us by pouring Thy Precious Blood on us (my family, etc.), which Thou hast shed for us and I ask Thee to command that any departing spirits leave quietly, without disturbance, and go straight to Thy Cross to dispose of as Thou sees fit. I ask Thee to bind any demonic interaction, interplay, or communications. I place N. (Person, place or thing) under the protection of the Blood of Jesus Christ which He shed for us.Amen


Now, please add to Fr. Ripperger's prayer's this ancient prayer of St. Patrick modified to bring binding protection to President Donald Trump. Please share this post and prayer to all your Christian friends. 

Binding Prayer for President Trump

([Download a PDF of this prayer here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/m29u2fblcmkrxuq/Binding%20Prayer%20Donald%20Trump.pdf?dl=0).)

I bind to Donald Trump today 
the strong virtue of an Invocation. 
 of the Trinity:   
I believe the Trinity in the Unity   
the Creator of the Universe.  

I bind to Donald Trump today   
the virtue of the Incarnation of 
 Christ with His Baptism,  
the virtue of His crucifixion  
with His burial,  
the virtue of His Resurrection  
with His Ascension,  
the virtue of His coming on  
the Judgement Day.  

I bind to Donald Trump today  
the virtue of the love of seraphim,  
in the obedience of angels,  
in the hope of resurrection unto reward,  
in prayers of Patriarchs,  
in predictions of Prophets,  
in preaching of Apostles,  
in faith of Confessors,  
in purity of holy Virgins,  
in deeds of righteous men.  

I bind to Donald Trump today   
the power of Heaven,  
the light of the sun,  
the brightness of the moon,   
the splendour of fire,  
the flashing of lightning,   
the swiftness of wind,  
the depth of sea,  
the stability of earth,  
the compactness of rocks.  

I bind to Donald Trump today  
God’s Power to guide him,  
God’s Might to uphold him,  
God’s Wisdom to teach him,  
God’s Eye to watch over him,  
God’s Ear to hear him,  
God’s Word to give him speech,  
God’s Hand to guide him,  
God’s Way to lie before him,  
God’s Shield to shelter him,  
God’s Host to secure him,  
against the snares of demons,  
against the seductions of vices,  
against the lusts of nature,  
against everyone who intends 
 injury to him, 
 whether far or near,  
 whether few or many. 

I invoke today all these virtues  
against every hostile merciless power  
that may assail his body and his soul:  
against the incantations of false prophets,  
against the black laws of heathenism,  
against the false laws of heresy,  
against the deceits of idolatry,  
against the spells of witches, and smiths, and druids,  
against every knowledge that binds the soul of man.  

Christ, protect him today  
 against every poison,  
 against burning,  
 against drowning,  
 against mortal wounding,   
that he may receive abundant reward.   

Christ with him, Christ before him,  
Christ behind him, Christ within him,  
Christ beneath him, Christ above him,  
Christ at his right, Christ at his left,  
Christ in the fort,  
Christ in the chariot seat,  
Christ in the ship,  
Christ in the heart of everyone who thinks of him,  
Christ in the mouth of everyone who speaks to him,  
Christ in every eye that sees him,  
Christ in every ear that hears him.  

I bind to Donald Trump today the strong virtue of an invocation  of the Trinity. I believe the Trinity in the Unity, the Creator  of the Universe.  

Amen.
