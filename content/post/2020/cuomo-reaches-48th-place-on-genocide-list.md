NEW YORK—New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's nursing home genocide passed the Chittagong Hill Tracts genocide of 1977 to take sole possession of 48th place in the all-time genocide list, according to Genocide Watch International. Cuomo is now only 3,100 deaths away from overtaking Slobodan Milošević's Bosnian genocide of 1992 to 1995 for 47th.

Over 5,200 nursing home residents in New York died to Coronavirus as a result of Cuomo's policy of placing elderly Coronavirus patients in otherwise disease-free facilities. Nursing homes are super-spreader facilities because of communal living, confined spaces, and the prevalence of complicating conditions among their populations. “Vulnerable people in one place, it is the feeding frenzy for this virus," Cuomo told reporters last month.

Economists estimate [the New York genocide will save the state nearly $600 million a year](https://hennessysview.com/did-cuomo-use-intentionally-kill-the-elderly/). 

"Well, it's a great honor, of course," the governor said during his daily Coronavirus update in response to a question by his brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo. "But I didn't do it alone. I mean, you had our commissioner of public health, Howard Zucker, and great cooperation from Mayor DeBlassio and so many others."

In a letter congratulating Governor Cuomo on his achievement, Genocide Watch chairman Alexy Vednikov wrote: "We are pleased to inform you that your Nursing Home Genocide of New York is the first certified genocide of the twenty-first century. Your creativity in using a pandemic to eliminate burdens to the state is an inspiration to despots everywhere."

Experts noted that Cuomo reached this milestone much faster than the Chittagong Hill Tract murderers who needed almost 20 years to amass somewhere between 4,000 and 13,000 deaths. 

"I got a lot of flak for the policy, as you know, but this distinction makes it all worthwhile," the governor said.

In recognition of the achievement, Governor Cuomo plans to build a 200-bed geriatric research center in upstate New York called "The COVID Center for Advanced Geriatric Solutions."
