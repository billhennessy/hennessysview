> Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker responded Friday afternoon to President Donald Trump's statement earlier in the day where Trump said he had deemed churches and other houses of worship "essential" and called on governors to allow them to reopen this weekend.
> 
> During his COVID-19 press briefing on Friday afternoon, Gov. Pritzker said **Illinois would continue to operate on the basis of science and data**.


If JB Pritzker, governor of Illinois, took science and data seriously, he'd drop about 280 pounds fast. Obesity is the first or second leading predictor of Coronavirus complications. 

Instead, he's eating an extra loaf of bread with his 7,000 calorie dinners. Pritzker's respect for science is lower than his respect for his toilet seat. 

But, being a world-class hypocrite, Pritzker huffed and puffed, stiff-kneed, his horizontally expansive body to the microphone bank to announce churches in Illinois will remain closed despite President Trump's warning to governors that [the First Amendment is still very much alive](https://hennessysview.com/presidents-authority-to-open-churches-is-constitution/). 

Abortion clinics, sex shops, and weed dispensaries are open in Illinois, mind you. But houses of worship are closed. You will be arrested if you happen to be one of the two or three who gather in His name. 

The same crackdown on worship is happening in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, and many other states run by Democrats. In fact, it's becoming abundantly clear to everyone that Democrats are using Coronavirus to kill religion, the way [New York Governor Andrew Cuomo used the disease to cut nursing home costs](https://hennessysview.com/did-cuomo-use-intentionally-kill-the-elderly/). This isn't about data and science; this is about the abolition of God. 

Of course, crooked academics and atheist doctors will provide these Democrat Dictators all the pseudo-data they need to finish their mission. American universities have been trying abolish religion for years. They're salivating at the chance to get God out of the country so their hero, Satan, can run the show unobstructed. 

The job of the people is to keep praying and defying unconstitutional dictates from petty tyrants like Pritzker. Channel first-century Christians who frequently died for their faith, not 21st-century "Karens" who use spy cams to rat out neighbor kids playing kickball in a field. 

JB Pritzker's science and data have killed thousands of Illinoisans and thrown hundreds of thousands or millions out of work. It's impossible to count the number of businesses he's ruined. Those jobs won't come back. His policies are a disaster. On the other hand, he sees his primary job as leaving God behind. But taking the cannolis, of course.
