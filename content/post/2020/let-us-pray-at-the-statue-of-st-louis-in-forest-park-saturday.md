By the grace of God, Jim Hoft, [the Gateway Pundit, has called all Catholic Christian men to pray the Rosary at the statue of St. Louis IX, King of France](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/06/calling-catholic-christian-men-allies-please-join-us-saturday-public-prayer-save-historic-st-louis-statue-forest-park/), on Art Hill in Forest Park at Noon on Saturday, June 28, 2020. Please join us. If you cannot join us, please pray for us. 

Pray that our intentions align with the will of God, that we do nothing out of vainglory or pride. 

Pray that God will soften the hearts of [those who threaten to suppress our prayer violently](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/06/update-radical-leftist-group-threatens-christian-prayer-rally-planned-saturday-save-iconic-st-louis-statue-forest-park/). 

Pray for those who seek to stop our prayer, that they will receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and join us. 

Pray that we respond to taunts and threats with charity and mercy. 

Pray for the intercession of Mary Our Lady of Victories, St. Joseph the Terror of Demons, St. Michael the Archangel who, by the power of God, cast into hell Satan and the evil spirits who prowl about the world seeking the ruin of souls. Pray, especially for the intercession of St. Louis. 

St. Louis was a humble man. Listen to this wonderful homily by Monsignor Eugene Morris given on the Feast of St. Louis in 2019:

### Be Peaceful and Vigilant

Please join us if you are able. If you do, remember this is a public prayer, not a protest or rally. Also, please depart the area expeditiously when asked. We are not there to confront or challenge anyone, but others might come to taunt and challenge us. Move in groups of six or more. Leave peaceably and quickly at the conclusion. Do not straggle. 

We ask that able-bodied young men watch out for those less able to defend themselves. 

### Pray the Lorica of St. Patrick for Deliverance

This is one of the most powerful prayers to ask for God's assistance to live well and protect ourselves and others from the devil's schemes and influence. Please pray it for yourselves and for the pilgrims who mount Art Hill on Saturday. (If praying for others, substitute their name or pronoun for the "me," "myself," and "I"):

#### Lorica (Breastplate) of St. Patrick

I bind to myself today the strong virtue of an Invocation of the Trinity: I believe the Trinity in the Unity the Creator of the Universe.

I bind to myself today the virtue of the Incarnation of Christ with His Baptism,   
the virtue of His crucifixion with His burial,   
the virtue of His Resurrection with His Ascension,   
the virtue of His coming on the Judgement Day.

I bind to myself today the virtue of the love of seraphim,  
in the obedience of angels,  
in the hope of resurrection unto reward,  
in prayers of Patriarchs,  
in predictions of Prophets,  
in preaching of Apostles,  
in faith of Confessors,  
in purity of holy Virgins,  
in deeds of righteous men.

I bind to myself today the power of Heaven,  
the light of the sun,  
the brightness of the moon,  
the splendour of fire,  
the flashing of lightning,  
the swiftness of wind,  
the depth of sea,  
the stability of earth,  
the compactness of rocks.

I bind to myself today God’s Power to guide me,  
God’s Might to uphold me,  
God’s Wisdom to teach me,  
God’s Eye to watch over me,  
God’s Ear to hear me,  
God’s Word to give me speech,  
God’s Hand to guide me,  
God’s Way to lie before me,  
God’s Shield to shelter me,  
God’s Host to secure me,  
against the snares of demons,  
against the seductions of vices,  
against the lusts of nature,  
against everyone who intends injury to me,  
whether far or near,  
whether few or many.

I invoke today all these virtues against every hostile merciless power that may assail my body and my soul:  
against the incantations of false prophets,  
against the black laws of heathenism,  
against the false laws of heresy,  
against the deceits of idolatry,  
against the spells of witches,  
and smiths,  
and druids,  
against every knowledge that binds the soul of man.

Christ, protect me today  
against every poison,  
against burning,  
against drowning,  
against mortal wounding,  
that I may receive abundant reward.

Christ with me,  
Christ before me,  
Christ behind me,  
Christ within me,   
Christ beneath me,  
Christ above me,  
Christ at my right,  
Christ at my left,  
Christ in the fort,  
Christ in the chariot seat,  
Christ in the ship,  
Christ in the heart of everyone who thinks of me,  
Christ in the mouth of everyone who speaks to me,  
Christ in every eye that sees me,  
Christ in every ear that hears me.

I bind to myself today the strong virtue of an invocation of the Trinity.   I believe the Trinity in the Unity, the Creator of the Universe.

Amen.

For the greater glory of God.
