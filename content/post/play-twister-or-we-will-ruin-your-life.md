Twister was a party game. 

It in solved a vinyl sheet with large dots in primary colors and a spinner board that pointed to a body part and a color. The caller spins the wheel (or wheels, I can't remember) and announces the next move: Right elbow, blue; left knee, red. Players would have to contort themselves accordingly. 

While peer pressure encouraged the shy to join in, playing Twister was completely voluntary. Those who chose to abstain had unencumbered access to the bar and cooler, so you might say they were the real winners. 

Now, the world is engaged in a global game of Twister but with less purpose. And those who choose to abstain are told to leave the party and never come back. They won't be invited to the next party, and they owe the host for the Manhattans they drank before they were unceremoniously ejected. 

We call it the COVID tango, and no where is it more ridiculous or sacrilegious than the Communion game at a Novus Ordo Mass. 

Here's an example: 

- Receive the Host *in your hand*
- Carry the Body and Blood, Soul and Divinity of your Lord and Savior 50 feet to a blue dot on the floor
- Without dropping the Host, pull down your mask
- Carefully place the Host in your mouth
- Without moving from the blue dot, replace your mask
- Walk away, never coming within six feet of any of God's other children

Nothing about this fiasco protects anyone's health. The process demeans the Sacrifice by elevating virus paranoia and blind obedience to civil authorities above hope in eternal life as promised by Jesus Christ and above proper reverence and humility before the exposed Body and Blood of Christ.

The motive for enforcing such rules seems, not health and safety, but a base desire for control. The princes of this world want to see just what people *won't* do. 

Each week, Novus Ordo parishes invent new, humiliating, and exaggerated behaviors which the faithful must carry out perfectly if the hope to be invited back next week. 

Each week, the faithful listen intently to the choreography instructionsâ€”much more intently to those profane commands than to the Word of God. People seem much more concerned about screwing up this week's mask dance than they are about screwing up the Divine instructions for navigating the narrow road and small gate that lead to life eternal. 

Beyond New Rite Catholic Churches, we see this mandatory Twister game played out in grocery stores, gas stations, and, especially, bars and restaurants.

- You must have a mask to enter
- You must wear the mask while transiting to the bar or to table
- You must wear the mask until your drinks arrive
- You may remove the mask for the next two hours, unless
- You have to use the bathroom, in which case
- You restore your mask before rising
- You wear your mask into the bathroom, in the bathroom, and returning from the bathroom
- You may remove the mask when seated at your table
- You must restore the mask when you rise to leave

No scientist is needed to tell you these random and arbitrary protocols are 100% hokum. They have zero effect on the transmission of Coronavirus or any other airborne pathogen. (If you can smell someone's perfume or cologne, you are breathing their germs.) 

I can't wait for the day when people, in large numbers, simply refuse to play these idiotic games. Stop playing Twister. See what if the "authorities" make good on their threats when 75 million Americans with good incomes and spending patterns walk away from their economy.
