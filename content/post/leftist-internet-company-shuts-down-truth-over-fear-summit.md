### Leftist Internet Company Shuts Down "Truth Over Fear: COVID-19 and The Great Reset" Summit In Effort to Silence Health Professionals Concerned About Lockdowns and Experimental Gene Therapy Injections

The oligarchs will stop at nothing to block the truth about COVID-19, the experimental gene therapy injection it spawned, and the people who sponsored the pandemic. The latest victim is Patrick Coffin and his Restore the Culture initiative. But read on for great news.

The software company Kartra, a division of [GenesisDigital](https://www.genesisdigital.co/about-us/) of LaJolla, California, pulled the plug on Patrick Coffin's "Truth Over Fear Summit" earlier today. Patrick Coffin had contracted with Kartra to host the summit online.

The move by Kartra and GenesisDigital appears **intended to prevent Coffin's subscribers from learning about the dangers of the COVID-19 vaccine, an experimental, unap**proved gene therapy that triggers a genetic mutation in humans. (That's it's intended effect, not a side-effect.)

Patrick Coffin, the host of the 3-day summit which drew over 45,000 viewers, wrote in an email to registered members:

> Today was full of fun and frolic as Kartra, the platform we used to host Truth Over Fear, hauled the entire summit off the internet during the live Q&A with Dr. Scott Jensen, MD, the next governor of Minnesota, while it was being watched by 45,000+ people.

In addition, Coffin's website www.restoretheculture.com has been attacked and is offline. Navigating to the site will produce this message:

{{< figure src="/images/Screen Shot 2021-05-02 at 8.28.22 PM.png" caption="https://restoretheculture.com is under coordinated internet attack as of 8:40 p.m. CDT on May 2, 2021" >}}

Searches for anything related to the Truth Over Fear Summit produce errors as the left focuses all its resources on blocking the truth. To find out what the summit is about, watch this awesome interview of Patrick Coffin on a recent episode of Fr. Richard Heilman's *Grace Force Podcast* with Doug Berry.

Patrick Coffin is a spiritual warrior for Jesus Christ who has been permanently banned from YouTube who refuses to relinquish Coffin's proprietary videos in violation of their own terms of service. (Never sign a contract with a leftist; they honor nothing, and no one will hold them to account.)

### Great News as Promised

The good news is that, thanks to Kartra's cooperation with evil, even more people will see the Truth Over Fear summit. Coffin will reproduce the summit next weekend, May 7-9, as he announced his email to subscribers:

> 1. GOOD NEWS: We will hold this summit next weekend at the same time (cue the stadium applause)! 
> 
> 2. MORE GOOD NEWS: If you bought a Premium Pass, don't worryâ€”you will get FREE access to your premium content next weekend. Nothing's changed but the date, now May 7-9, 2021. 

If you subscribed to the "Truth Over Fear" summit, there's this:

> We will email you (only premium members) to let you know. The registration page will be the same: www.restoretheculture.com. Don't go there now, but check back in 3-4 days! 

I urge you to bookmark www.restoretheculture.com and check it every day until Coffin redirects the DNS entries to his host. (We will not name the new host because Satan and his human supporters will attack them.)

Folks, our battle is not against flesh blood. [Read Ephisians 6:10-19 for more information](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:10-19&version=NIV). 

**Say a prayer, right now, for Patrick Coffin and his work**. And join him next weekend for the Truth Over Fear summit. In fact, buy a premium pass to help him overcome the evil damages wrought by Kartra and GenesisDigital (whose CEO is Sarah Jenkins).
