Darcy was pretty quiet last night. I told her need to stop buying stuff that isn't absolutely necessary. She didn't respond. I know she's mad at me. She didn't want to get the vaccine, either, but she finally gave in to save her job. I'm sure she thinks I'm shirking my responsibilities to the family, to her. Maybe I am. 

But it's kind of late now. People who got the jab after they'd been fired are not finding work. They're labeled "not team players" no matter how talented or hardworking they are. It's a scarlet letter. 

John M. is coming over tomorrow to look at the house and talk about how to list it. Thank God for John. I just wish I'd done more to the house while I could. 

Cancelled a bunch of subscriptions this morning. Satellite radio, a bunch of business related stuff, monthly donations. 

Need to make the food that's in the bottom of the freezer last a while. And start getting used to no air conditioning. Glad I taught myself to take cold showers years ago. 

Looking on Zillow and adding up my assets, I realize our new abode might be more humble than I thought. Darcy will make a little income, but we're going to have to look for something really cheap, near a river and with land. That means way out there.
