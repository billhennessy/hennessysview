Got the news today. Boss dropped a Zoom meeting on my calendar last night for 9:30 this morning. "Touch base" was the subject. (They always us "touch base" or "catch up" for these meetings.)

"Hey, Mike, how are you today?" he started. I don't remember what I said. "Listen," he continued, "this is about the most distasteful call I've ever had to make. We are going to have to let you go. I think it's admirable what you're doing, sticking to your beliefs, but we have to think about the company and all the employees. The government and our clients will not let us stay in business without one-hundred percent compliance on the vaccine."

I finally got a chance to speak. Said I don't hold any bad feelings for him or the company. We are all weak. Asked what happens now.

"We're going to take care of you best we can." He rattled off my benefits. I can withdraw from 401k without penalty. I get two weeks of severance, but no medical benefits since I was kicked off the plan a month ago. And Dave, my boss, would be happy to recommend "in the strongest terms." 

So, that was it. Fifteen years with the company surviving the financial meltdown, the COVID shutdown, and numerous terrible decisions by the company's executives. I get two weeks salary and access to my 401k. 

Darcy said, "they can't do that," but when I just looked at her, she stopped. She went to the store to get something for the dogs. 

I'm kind of lucky. I have a few months income in savings and a decent amount in the 401k. Maybe $120k in equity in the house. 

the plan from here is about what I've been thinking for a few years. Before covid:

- Put the house up for sale. Probably give up $20k to sell as-is
- Add to my precious medals savings
- Buy a small house with 10 or 15 acres somewhere in the middle of nowhere
- Sell all the stuff we won't need there: computers, pads, most of our phones, etc. 
- Invest what we can in off-grid technology: geothermal, wood furnace, solar panals, and the like
- Plant a big garden and get chickens
- Maybe learn to raise a few pigs and cows for meat
- Stock up on practical clothes that will last
- Buy some more hand tools
- Try to live as self-sufficiently as possible

Time to get going
