### THEY WANT DEDICATED LEGISLATORS TO FIND OUT WHO ORDERED OR INFLUENCED DRACONIAN LOCKDOWNS AND REGULATIONS

**Take Off Tuesday. Head to Jefferson City to fill the Rotunda of the State Capitol. This is HUGE
**
Missouri residents are taking over the rotunda of the State Capitol next Tuesday to hold their own forum on the effects of pandemic lockdown restrictions on vulnerable citizens in need of professional care. The hearings are open to the public and will include testimony from a half-dozen Missourian victims whose loved ones were isolated and afraid in the final days.

### NO MASKS REQUIRED!!!

The list of **witnesses includes Dr. Karladine Graves**, a Kansas City area physician, one of America's Frontline Doctors. Dr. Graves is expected to testify of the physiological effects of isolation, masking, and forced separation from loved ones with Q&A.

This Town Hall intends to trigger investigations that will uncover the people and organizations that hatched and continued those lockdowns against the better judgment of many medical experts like Dr. Graves.

### WAKE THE KIDS. PHONE THE NEIGHBORS!

The Town Hall hearing will be held in the rotunda of the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City on Tuesday, May 4 from noon to 1:00 p.m. Everyone who was affected by the pandemic restrictions is encouraged to attend and participate.
