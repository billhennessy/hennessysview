I've been reading accounts of the brutal dictatorship that has taken over Australia. You won't find this in the mainstream media. But you need to read these accounts to understand what life will be like in the United States very soon. (I will drop some links below.)

Here are some highlights:

- Police beatings have become routine. Police have beaten small children, the elderly, and everyone in between. The beatings are public. Police make no attempt to conceal their thuggery. They seem to enjoy watching videos of their brutality on social media platforms. The police in Australia are every bit as evil as KGB or Gestapo. 
- People are incarcerated in their homes 23 hours a day. One family member may leave to shop for one hour a day. All may exercise outdoors one hour a day. Violators are beaten, arrested, and interned in concentration camps.
- "Government is dictating what businesses are allowed to trade, and which employees are allowed to work, and this can change every few days."
- "Citizens are NOT allowed more than 3 miles from their home with out a government issued work permit. We have police army and helicopters patrolling the streets to make sure people don’t leave their homes."
- "According to the Australian Small Business Council, over 140,000 businesses have closed down due to lockdowns."

That is just a small sample of the ruthless enslavement of the Australian people. Because of the Australia's strict gun control laws, they have no means to fight back. 

Meanwhile, Australia's worst-in-the-world lockdown has triggered a **massive increase in COVID infections.**

### The Mark of the Beast

Australia has made COVID vaccines mandatory for any form of commercial trade. Aussies may not buy, sell, or trade without the mark of the beast.

On March 30, 2021, [I warned that the vaccine passport](https://www.hennessysview.com/a-hill-to-die-on/) might be the mark of the beast of Revelation.

The Vaccine Passport is coming. It will be required to travel, yes, but also to transact, to buy or sell online, to hold a bank account, to hold a job. It’s coming.

Is this passport the “mark of the beast” from Revelation 13 and 14?

I also admitted I didn't know for certain whether the mRNA vaccine is the mark or not. I still don't. And I don't expect to know until I get to the other side. 

When I wrote that post in March, the media and government were still mocking "vaccine passports" as looney conspiracy theories promulgated by angry Trump supporters. People ridiculed me for writing the post.

Just six months later we are living in a dystopian nightmare worse than I predicted.

This thing, though, bears a remarkable resemblance to the mark in Revelation. The vaccine passport will demonstrate complete allegiance with man and little faith in God. Bearers of the mark might profess faith in God, but their actions speak louder than words. (Have you noticed how, in recent years, the culture has made words more important than actions?)

Soon, you will not be allowed to live in your home without a vaccine, at least not in a subdivision or apartment. As I predicted on April 4, homeowners associations and landlords will begin evicting residents who lack the mark. Here are my four major predictions for vaccine passports in the United States:

{{< blockquote author="Bill Hennessy" link="https://www.hennessysview.com/this-is-what-will-happen/" title="This Is What Will Happen" >}}
First, we can see from recent CDC guidelines, with full support from airlines, that flying will be almost impossible for those who have not been vaccinated. You will be required to obtain tests before and after your trip, and you will have to quarantine for two weeks upon arrival at your destination, and again upon returning home. That means a one-hour flight from St. Louis to Kansas City for a one-hour meeting will take a month. You could walk it faster. Same goes for buses and Amtrak. And, while you could drive, you will still technically be required to do the 4-week quarantine.

Second, you will come under increasing pressure from your employer. You will likely be hit with a draconian health insurance surcharge of up to $200 a month. Or, you may be dropped altogether. You will be required to wear a mask whenever you’re on company property, including outside and in your car. You will not be allowed physically in meetings with others, so you’ll be joining from your desk on Zoom. Eventually, you will be asked to leave the company. If you don’t, you will be terminated. And, good luck finding a company that both needs your skills and defies government and insurance-company pressure to have a 100%-vaccinated workforce. (You’ll be hearing about this initiative very soon.)

Third, you will not be allowed to shop. Apple Pay, PayPal, Amazon, and Walmart are already preparing to require proof of vaccination in order to shop online, much less in a retail location. Grocery stores are already requiring masks far beyond local dictates. They, too, will bar entry for the non-vaccinated. You better enjoy gardening and raising chickens.

Fourth, homeowners associations and apartment management companies will get into the act. If you live in a subdivision or rent, you will probably be given a few months to get the jab or get out. (Without a job, this might happen sooner.) If you’re relying on the unlawful eviction moratorium, guess what? It won’t apply if the reason for the eviction is your refusal to get the shot.

All of these things will come about by this time in 2022, but most will start much sooner.

I'm sure people will scoff at what I'm about to say next even though you have to admit my predictions from March and April have been proven nearly 100 percent accurate. That's okay. I have to tell what's going to happen.

### Survivors Will Envy the Dead

In Australia, citizens are being shoved into concentration camps. Here's a video released anonymously by an inmate in one of the camps:

{{< blockquote author="Unknown" link="https://vidmax.com/video/207091-aussie-who-is-vaccinated-and-tested-negative" title="Mental Breakdowns at Australian Concentration Camp" >}}
No air, no leaving the room for 338 hours, the second time in my 11 days here someone has totally smashed up their room, babies crying. I think this guy thought he was leaving today when he is actually leaving at 11.59 pm tonight. You go crazy being all alone. Is this really necessary? I myself had 9 negative tests before being denied quarantine at home and I am vaccinated. Why? What is the price of Victorian's mental health? does anyone actually care? This guy is threatened to be gassed by authorities if he doesn't calm down ?? WTF!
{{< /blockquote >}}

This is what happens when you intern formerly free citizens "for their own good." And this is coming to America. 

Vaccine holdouts will be rounded up and interned, including those who tire of getting the 5-month booster shots for the rest of their lives.

Try to imagine how you will respond to indefinite incarceration without trial, with no possibility of trial. Imagine that you are constantly teased with false release dates that come and go. With no communication from your family or friends. No lawyer to meet with to discuss your case. Completely at the whims of faceless bureaucrats and psychopathic police who threaten to "gas" you if you don't obey. 

How soon, under such conditions, would you begin to envy the dead? The dead by COVID or by vaccine complications or by police bullets or batons. 

### The Compliant Will Be Slaves

In a weird way, the incarcerated holdouts will fare *better* than the compliant slaves who dutifully line up to get their booster shots every month, who video themselves taking their daily oral booster from Pfizer. Those who verify insertion of the weekly anti-COVID suppository that's in the works at Moderna. 

The compliant will lose all sense of agency. They will, through practice and submission, become jelly in the system's hands, allowing themselves to be molded into anything the state desires. 

They will take degrading jobs to satisfy the system. The young and attractive will become sex workers for the system's insiders. The old and feeble will be left to die or euthanized. Everyone else will be assigned duties irrespective of their talents or desires. 

This is what lies ahead for you, America: slave or prisoner. Those will be your choices. 

### Prepare Now
