In a sweeping and vengeful motu proprio, Pope Francis severely restricted the Traditional Latin Mass and harshly rebuked all who celebrate the Mass. 

Implying that Latin Mass parishes are dividing the Catholic Church, Francis nullified his predecessor's motu proprio *Pontificum Summorum* that affirmed the right of every Catholic priest to use the 1962 Missal. Francis gave bishops the power to cancel Latin Mass oratories, parishes, and masses, and ordered bishops to appoint overseers to direct any Traditional Catholic community allowed to remain in operation. 

The motu proprio and its cover letter direct bishops to begin in inquisition of traditional Catholics to root out anyone who questions the validity or legitimacy of the Second Vatican Council, now 56 years old. 

Further, at a time when Traditional Catholic seminaries are overflowing with seminarians and applicants, Francis effectively shut down those seminaries by prohibiting any priest ordained after July 16, 2021, from saying the Latin Mass without Vatican approval. 

The pope's move seems designed to kill the liturgical form instituted in the wake of the Protestant Revolution. 

### "You Did Not Deserve This"

A visiting priest began his homily Sunday telling my parish, "You did not deserve this." He then looked down and to his left to fight back tears. 

While many Catholics expected Bergoglio to take *some* action to restrict the Latin Mass and Traditional Catholic communities which are flourishing, no one expected such a sweeping indictment of both the ancient and reverent liturgy nor of the bishops, priests, and laity who practice this venerable faith. 

So the pope has given bishops the power to abolish the Latin Mass at their whims. He has taken upon himself the right to grant future priests the privilege of this faculty. He has placed the Latin Mass orders—the Fraternity of St. Peter and the Institute of Christ the King and others—under the complete control of office headed by men who despise the Latin Mass. 

Well, no surprise, really. So what do Trads do now?

We laugh.

### Grinning with the Gipper

{{< video kings-row.mp4 600 400 >}}

The pope's sadistic amputation of Catholic tradition exposes his ignorance of what motivates traditional Catholics. Bergoglio apparently believes the Trads are as poorly catechized as the 70 percent of Catholics who don't even believe that the Eucharist is true Body, Blood, Soul, and Divinity of Jesus Christ. He must think we're as tepid as the 80 percent who do not go to Mass on Sundays, much less Holy Days of Obligation. 

But our faith goes a bit deeper than that. It begins with the understanding that the Mass, the Eucharist, were given to us as a means of worshipping God the way He wants us to worship Him. We love the Latin Mass, not because we are rigid, but because that Mass is about God. Unlike the *Novus Ordo* Mass, the Tridentine Mass focuses on the First and Greatest Commandment. (The social hour after Mass is for the Second.) 

The TLM is rigid only in its attempt to worship God as perfectly as humans can worship God. The strict rules are not for God's sake but for ours, to keep us from introducing novelties that take us off the path God wishes us to follow. 

As I wrote some years ago, the Latin Mass is best for me because [I cannot be trusted when left to my own devices](https://www.hennessysview.com/post/2019/im-not-good-enough/). I learned how to shop around for a priest who will tell me it's okay to do whatever I damn well please. And I have done that. And it didn't work. It didn't work in this life, and it threatened to cut me off from the next. 

Instead of screaming at the pope, I laugh at him the way Ronald Reagan laughed at the sadistic doctor who cut off his legs in *King's Row*. 

Did the pope really think our faith depended on *Sumorum Pontificum*? No more than Reagan lived in his legs. 

So, say a Rosary every day. But, today, say it for Jorge Bergoglio who is about to find out that the Trade didn't curl up in a fetal position or grab our torches and pitchforks. We did grab a weapon, though: we grabbed the Most Holy Rosary of the Blessed Virgin Mary. We went to the Mass of the Ages on Sunday in overwhelming numbers. And we laughed all the way to altar rail. 

We laughed, not out of spite but out of joy. Not happiness, but joy. The joy that comes from being asked by Christ and His vicar to suffer for Him and with Him. We laughed in thanksgiving for being asked to imitate Simon of Cyrene and carry the cross a few paces. We laughed in anticipation of our trials in the new Inquisition because we trust in Christ's promises in Luke 12:11-12:

>  When you are brought before synagogues, rulers, and authorities, do not worry about how to defend yourselves or what to say. For at that time the Holy Spirit will teach you what you should say."

So, thank you, Holy Father, for giving us this test. As we pray for you, please return the favor: say a prayer for your amputees that we pass this test that we might one day hear the only words, in any language, a Christian lives and dies to hear:

> Well done, good and faithful servant! You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!

*Ad majorem Dei glosam!*
