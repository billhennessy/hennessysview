When the Chicago Black Sox scandal hit the news, the most heartbroken were the kids who idolized their South Side White Sox who were accused of throwing the 1908 World Series for money. 

The fan favorite of that era was Shoeless Joe Jackson. On a Chicago street, he was confronted by young boy fraught with anxious worry over the accusations leveled against his childhood heroes. The boy looked up as idol and said, "Say it ain't so, Joe." 

Many pro-military American veterans know now how that kid felt. The one last pillar of American strength and character has been exposed as a fraud. All the cliches that reflect the U.S. military's centuries of honor, valor, and commitment shattered into "just a few hundreds" of pieces. The last distinctly American institution with pride now slouches in shame.
