**Expect Joe Biden to resign or be declared unfit under the 25th Amendment before Labor Day.**

Last Thursday, I got the sense that Biden would not return from his two-week vacation. 

There was a certain air of defeat and resignation in his demeanor. I can't quite put a finger on exactly what.

It's clear that Joe Biden is not up to the job of president. That conclusion was clear long before the election. I suspect his unfitness was becoming obvious to him and to his wife, too.

Since then, the reasons for Biden have only multiplied. The Saigon-esque humiliation in Kabul is only the most visible disaster of the past few days. What transpired with his Vice President was even worse.

According to White House officials, Biden asked Kamala Harris to join him in the East Room press address to the nation on the disaster in Afghanistan. She refused. The two factions' handlers argued, causing a 20-minute delay in the start of the speech. 

Then, last night, Jack Posobiec reported that White House officials leaked that Kamala Harris was talking about the 25th Amendment "in a non-joking way."

Whenever the Vice President and a majority of the principal officers of the executive departments transmit to Congress their written declaration that the President is unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, the Vice President shall immediately assume office.

Immediately after the President's address yesterday, the media were agog at his brilliance, his statesmanship, and his humility. But that changed as the evening went along. The talking point changed. Or the source of talking points changed.

I suspect the source of the media's talking points changed from  Team Biden to Team Harris. 

The new talking points, repeated on CNN throughout the evening, seriously question Biden's competence. Unnamed White House sources revealed that Biden refused to listen to anyone: the VP, the DOJ, the CIA, Afghanistan officials. "Everyone knew this would be a catastrophe," they said. 

An overnight poll showed 70 percent of Americans disapprove of Biden's handling of Afghanistan. 

The dominoes are ready to fall on the short, failed presidency of Joe Biden.

A few weeks ago, I blogged about the fall of Rome. One of the contributing factors was a quick succession of emperors. A new emperor would rise only to be ousted by one of the men who assisted his ascent. 

As we prepare for President Harris, it's worth noting two ominous thoughts:

1. China is preparing to invade Taiwan. Like Kabul, it will fall in just hours. China will control over 90 percent of semiconductor chip manufacturing in the world.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) on Tuesday launched joint live-fire assault drills in multiple locations near the island of Taiwan in response to recent collusion and provocations by the US and Taiwan secessionists.

2. The American Empire is in its in final days.

Put your trust in God, not in man. Things will unravel quickly from this point forward. Faster than you can imagine.
