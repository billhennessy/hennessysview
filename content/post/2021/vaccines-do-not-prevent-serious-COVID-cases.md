Vaccinated people are as likely as the unvaccinated to suffer serious illness from COVID. [Via Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-21/science-can-t-keep-up-with-virus-creating-worry-for-vaccinated):

> And now, there’s growing concern that vaccinated people may be more vulnerable to serious illness than previously thought.

If America still had a free press, this news would be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Israel recently reported that over half of COVID hospitalization in July were fully vaccinated. From [Science Magazine](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/08/grim-warning-israel-vaccination-blunts-does-not-defeat-delta):

> As of 15 August, 514 Israelis were hospitalized with severe or critical COVID-19, a 31% increase from just 4 days earlier. Of the 514, **59% were fully vaccinated**. Of the vaccinated, 87% were 60 or older. **“There are so many breakthrough infections that they dominate and most of the hospitalized patients are actually vaccinated,”** says Uri Shalit, a bioinformatician at the Israel Institute of Technology (Technion) who has consulted on COVID-19 for the government.

Moreover, the CDC continues to use two different sets of data when evaluating the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. For the vaccinated, they use recent data, but for the unvaccinated, they use all day since January when almost no one was vaccinated and doctors were still following a flawed treatment protocol that actually made patients more likely to die. 

The death and hospitalization rates in June, July, and August are much lower than they were in January and February. What the CDC does not report is the current hospitalization and death rates of the unvaccinated in the three most-recent months. Why? 

We were told that the vaccine will prevent contraction and transmission of the disease: WRONG.

We were then told that the vaccine would prevent serious illness and death: WRONG.

What are we to believe now? Only this: the vaccine is not a preventive but a symbol of submission to the god of government and the god of medicine. 

Submit to no one except the God of the Torah and the Gospel. 

### What Will You Sacrifice?

Refusing to submit means sacrificing. It means giving up some convenience and comfort. It may mean losing your job and your home. It might cost you everything in this world.

But what's the alternative? 

If you refuse to risk your leisure and comfort and financial security, you must deny Christ and embrace demons.

> No, but the sacrifices of pagans are offered to demons, not to God, and I do not want you to be participants with demons. (1 Corinthians 10:20)

We are so addicted to comfort and convenience. Most of us won't even drive an extra two miles to bypass businesses that cooperate with evil. For example, Schnuck's and QuikTrip recently agreed to enforce St. Louis County's illegal mask mandate. Did you dutifully don your mask to give money to those stores? Or did you drive an extra mile or two to give your business to a company that actually agrees with you?

If you cannot be bothered with such small inconveniences, how will you resist the big temptations? 

### The Vaccine IS the Hill to Die On

Back when the St. Louis Tea Party was going strong, I often found myself asking my comrades, "Is this the hill to die on?" My point was, why take a stand on something that doesn't really matter? Why harass the enemy just for the sake of harassment? 

My rationale: if we know this issue we're rallying about isn't that important, we will abandon it, making ourselves look fickle and weak. Instead, let's prepare for the monumental battle, the battle worth dying for. 

Clearly, the vaccine is that monumental battle. The ineffective and dangerous vaccine has nothing to do with Coronavirus and everything to do with submission. This battle pits the elites of the government, academia, and even the Vatican against the lowly Tea Party types who just want to live their lives free from the arbitrary rule of other men. 

The vaccine has replaced the mask as the elites symbol of compliance with their One World Government ambition. The vaccine will be followed by artificial "meat", common property, and assigned occupations. And, of course, you will lose your guns. 

In short, as more people submit, the dimmer the hope for humanity.

### Say "No" to the Vaccine, but Prepare for COVID

As I wrote last week, [you will get COVID](https://www.hennessysview.com/covid-personal-responsibility/). It's endemic, meaning it's just part of the ecosystem now, like the flu and colds. It will wane and resurge for the remainder of human existence. 

As with the flu, some people will get very sick when they catch COVID. The very sick will be subject to bad medicine. Hospitals and most doctors will not prescribe the treatment protocols that actually work: HCQ or Ivermectin. Instead, they will treat you with experimental, expensive drugs pushed by their pharma salesmen. 

Your mission is to be prepared to treat yourself and your family at home. This involves keeping on hand the right medications and supplements. 

1. Go to this website and begin your consultation: [Speak With an MD](https://speakwithanmd.com/americasfrontlinedoctors/)
2. You can choose either a video consultation or an email consultation. 
3. After the consultation, the doctor will write a prescription based on your health status, age, and bodyweight. (Ivermectin is very weight-dependent, so you cannot share your prescription with others)
4. Prescriptions are prioritized based on your situation. If you have symptoms, you're at the top of the list. 
5. Know the Zelenko protocol and the modified Frontline Doctors  protocol: [Prevention and Treatment Protocols](https://americasfrontlinedoctors.org/treatments/hydroxychloroquine/treatment-protocols/)
6. When you receive your meds, inventory the contents and store them in a safe place.

Most important, pray without ceasing. Do everything for the greater glory of God. The good guys win in the end.
