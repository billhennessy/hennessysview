{{< blockquote author="Donald J. Trump" title="December 29, 2015" >}}
I know words, I have the best words.
{{< /blockquote >}}

Who talks like that? "I have the best words." What does it even mean?

If you think about it, "I have the best words" makes no sense. No one has his own language. Trump has the same words the rest of us do. 

Yet, everyone knew what it meant. Trump's 5-word sentence conveyed more meaning than the hundreds of 2,000-word articles by English professors meant to denigrate then candidate Trump. 

It's because Trump talks like his audience. He talks like an electrician sitting at the bar after work on a Friday before he goes home to "face the little woman."
