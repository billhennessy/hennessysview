I love (almost) every dog I meet, but not all the same way. 

Coco didn't like me when we first brought her into our home. My wife found her on a rescue site. She was a seven-year-old Yorkshire Terrier who was "retired" from breeding after eight litters. Her owner had taken her to be put to sleep. The vet found a rescue foster family to keep her until my wife came along. 

Here's the photo that stole my wife's heart.

Coco arrived in July, 2015, about a month after we'd moved into our present home. She was third rescue dog in the house: a surly but lovable Yorkie Poo named Stella (the most wonderful dog in the world by her own admission), and Willow, an elderly German Shepherd.

No, Coco, didn't take an instant liking to me, but she latched onto my wife like her own mother. The two were inseparable whenever my wife was home. Coco even followed her into the bathroom. 

If my wife happened to slip into the bathroom before Coco, Coco would sit as still as a statue staring at the door until it opened.
