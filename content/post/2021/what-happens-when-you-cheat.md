On Wednesday, the company I work for had a party to celebrate the reopening of our campus. What a joy to be around great friends, many of whom I had not seen in person in well over a year. 
And there were adult beverages. And I'm following a strict ketogenic diet. I had a couple of glasses of dry red wine with my friends. But cheating has consequences. 

I recently learned from Dr. Annette Bosworth that it takes a long time for the human body to run on ketones (fat) by default. My body spent five decades operating primarily on carbohydrates. I have trained my body to burn sugar and turn any surplus sugar into fat. 

I recently starved my body of its sugar addition, providing it less than 20 grams of carbohydrates a day. And I shocked my system with a five-day water-only fast (zero calories of any kind) to kick off this rejuvenation. 

After two weeks of fasting a strict keto, I got my glucose-ketone index below 3.0 for 17 consecutive days, below 2.0 for five straight days, and below 1.0 two days in a row. 

And, while alcohol is not a real carbohydrate, it stops ketogenesis while it's in the body. The body will use alcohol, a very efficient fuel, before producing ketones. (The liver can only do one thing at a time.)

So how much of an effect do two glasses of wine have on ketosis? You might be surprised. 

{{< figure src="/images/cheat-point.png" caption="GKI soared to 2.4, then 3.1 in the 36 hours after consuming two glasses of wine." >}}

Am I giving up? Hell, no.

Look, my GKI is still below 4.0, which means I have mild therapeutic ketosis going on. I'm still producing more HGH and stem cells than 90% of people my age. I'm still burning more body fat than dietary sugar. 

And, I'm planning to do a full, 36- to 48-hour water-only fast every Friday (which I am in the midst of right now.) I ate dinner on Thursday at about 8:00 p.m., and I won't consume another calorie, God willing, until afternoon on Saturday. (I fast on Fridays for both religious and practical purposes.) 

I expect my GKI to be below 2.0 on Saturday morning, which means I will back into high therapeutic ketosis. 

No diet or dietary lifestyle should make you miserable. Just know your numbers, so you know how to compensate for cheating. And make cheating a rare, happy event, not a daily practice. The daily routine is to [poke the "Bigs" in the eye](https://www.hennessysview.com/poke-the-bigs-in-the-eye/) so you can live happily, healthily, and vibrantly for as long as God keeps you in exile in this valley of tears. **You want stamina, resilience, and energy to stand when all about you fall**.

Eat meat, lose weight, get strong. That's what this is all about. The side effect will be fewer prescriptions, less pain, more energy, and smaller-sized clothes. 

Not bad.
