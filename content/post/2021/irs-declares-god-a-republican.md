It's official: God is a Republican according to the Internal Revenue Service. And I'm not making this up. 

The IRS rejected a Christian group's application for tax-exempt status because, in the judgment of the IRS, teaching Biblical values is the same as advocating for the Republican Party. From Fox Business [via The Gateway Pundit](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/06/irs-denies-texas-based-christian-group-tax-exempt-status-claims-bibles-teachings-affiliated-gop/):

> “While you educate voters on what the bible says about issues, your educational activities are not neutral,” [the IRS] wrote. “The topics typically are affiliated with distinct candidates and specific political party platforms.”

Now that the US government has made it official, Fr. James Altman can take a victory lap. 

Despite being suspended as pastor of his parish by weak and cowardly bishop, Altman declared in 2020 that Catholics cannot vote Democrat in a viral video.

Some people are treating the IRS's ruling as setback for Christianity. But this is a big win. The wicked government of the United States of America has finally admitted that it opposes God and hates the teachings of Christ.

This is why I have publicly **disavowed the United States government**. You cannot be a Christian *and* support the government of the United States which has become antithetical to both the Constitution and God. 

Or to quote Fr. Altman: You can't be a Catholic and vote Democrat. 

The truth will out.
