{{< blockquote author="George Orwell" link="LINK" title="1984" >}}
Do you realize that the past, starting from yesterday, has been actually abolished? If it survives anywhere, itâ€™s in a few solid objects with no words attached to them, like that lump of glass there. Already we know almost literally nothing about the Revolution and the years before the Revolution. Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book has been rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street and building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And that process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right.
{{< /blockquote >}}

Winston Smith, the protagonist of George Orwell's prophetic novel *1984* works in the Ministry of Truth. His job is to rewrite snippets of history so as to destroy any evidence that the past was as it was rather than as Big Brother and the Party wish it to have been. 

When Winston is done with those fragments of evidence from the past, he drops them into a memory hole where the past is burned in a never-ending inferno in bowels of the Ministry of Truth. 

Pope Francis (Bergoglio) is the new Big Brother and his Vatican junta The Party. *Traditiones Custodis* is the pope's latest maneuvering in destroying the history of the Church prior to Vatican II.
