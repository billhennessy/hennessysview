And the Idiots Droned On

Unbeknownst to the 200 million idiots who get their news from mainstream media, the CDC dropped numerous atom bombs of COVID and vaccine reality last week. 

- Vaccines do not protect against infection
- Vaccines do not lessen the severity of infection
- Vaccinated people with COVID transmit the disease as efficiently as non-vaccinated
- Sixty percent of hospitalizations in a recent Massachusetts outbreak were fully vaccinated
- The PCR used for 16 months cannot distinguish COVID from the flu, therefore most of diagnosed COVID cases in the last year were actually influenza

No one else will summarize these data, so I will:

### The vaccine does not work as described

That's all you need to know, really. And the evidence is become obvious. 

For example, Pfizer announced on July 28, 2021, that **its vaccine will not work and that those infected will require anti-virals like HCQ or Ivermectin** (thought Pfizer, of course, did not mention those generics. They will insist on one of their own anti-vrial patentsl)

{{< figure src="/images/pfizer-anti-viral.png" caption="Pfizer admits that anti-virals are more effective than their own vaccine." >}}

Meanwhile, Anthony "Little Hitler" Fauci continues to lie about . . . well, everything. Last week Fauci claimed "99.2 percent of COVID deaths are among the unvaccinated." What he didn't tell you as that that includes every COVID-attributed death since the first in February of 2020. That's lying with numbers. He would be expelled from any university if he used such deceptive math in a statistics class. We know this only thanks to former NY Times journalist Alex Berenson:

Vaccine advocates rarely acknowledge the fact that deaths started dropping long before most people had received shots. In reality, even acknowledging that many people who received vaccines in January and February were older and vulnerable, seasonality and herd immunity seem to have had a greater impact on broad Covid trends than vaccinations.

In fact, in countries like the UK and Israel where the majority of the population was innoculated early in 2021, the vast majority of new cases and new hospitalizations and deaths are among the fully vaccinated. 

Fauci denies this, because it proves beyond a reasonable doubt the vaccines don't work. As I wrote in May of 2020, there was only a slim chance the vaccines would work: 


Yet, the government and the medical community continue to push the vaccine. In fact, in Australia, the army is hunting people down on the streets and forcibly vaccinating. 



In the United States we hear increasing calls for forced vaccinations. Government officials, doctors, and media have called for a list of punishments for those who are not vaccinated:

- No job
- No school
- No healthcare
- No shopping

They might as well just chant "Death to the unvaccinated." A vaccine that the CDC now admits **does not work**. 

Meanwhile, the Biden administration is planning to impose another complete lockdown beginning the week of August 9. The "experts" will blame the need for this lockdown on the unvaccinated. 

Their goal is to make the unvaccinated reviled by their friends, families, coworkers, and neighbors. The goal is to make the unvaccinated scapegoats. The goal is to foment a frothing, snarling hatred for the unvaccinated akin to the hatred of Jews in 1930s Germany. 

And there is a method to their madness. Here are the 10 stages of genocide:

{{< figure src="/images/E7gUBoXXIAEw4aY.jpeg" caption="10 Stages of Genocide. We are at Stage 6, though Stages 1 through 5 continue simultaneously. This is moving very fast." >}}

This frothing hatred of the unvaccinated is required for Stage 8, where ordinary citizens begin to take it upon themselves to torture and kill their fellow citizens, the people we are told are responsible for economic collapse and loss of freedom. Just as the Jews were blamed for all of Germany's woes. 

I know. I'm paranoid. I'm negative. I'm "divisive." People said the same about my posts from April:

Very likely, those who refuse to take the jab or who refuse to prove they’ve taken it will be denied entry into almost everywhere. They will not be allowed into their place of work. They will not be allowed into stores. They will not be allowed into movie theaters or sports venues or concerts. They may not even be allowed into churches. They will not be allowed to vote in person. What’s worse: they will be ostracized by family and friends.

Yet, here we are. Vaccine passports are coming, as are forced vaccinations. 

Back in April, I also wrote that receiving the jab could be idolatry, a grave sin against the First Commandment.

We don’t know if the COVID vaccine passport is the mark of the beast, but only a fool would dismiss the possibility. And there’s hell to pay if you make the wrong choice.
