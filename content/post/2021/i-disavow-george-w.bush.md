One duty of a man is to call out his own mistakes in life. 

Back in 2000, I campaigned hard for George W. Bush. I took a week of vacation to work phones and knock doors. I spent money I didn't have on Bush shirts, buttons, bumperstickers, and yard signs to give to everyone I met. My house looked like a Bush campaign headquarters. 

History has proven that I was wrong. 

While Al Gore was a tool and a buffoon, he does not appear to have been an insider in the New World Order cabal. George W. Bush was. 

The Smirking Chimp used conservative principles on issues of the day while quietly surrendering America's very independence. As if our national sovereignty were his to give away. 

Today, on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, George W. Bush said I am no better than the men who flew planes into the Twin Towers. He signaled a willingness to murder Trump supporters simply for being Trump supporters. 

I am trying to reduce the amount of profanity I utter and write, but I know no other response than to say, "Fuck you."
