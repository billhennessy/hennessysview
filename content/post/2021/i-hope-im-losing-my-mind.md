Their true advantage, as any one of them would attest, stemmed from one thing only; the dedication of each to Spirit as such. To that personage they all described as the Prince. The advantages afforded by that abiding interest seemed infinite to them. The simple fact that their interest did not conform to the interest asserted by the major religions meant they were able to think in a more universal way than they would have as Jews or Christians or Muslims. They were therefore more tolerant. More human.

For years this blog has warned that America (and, indeed, the whole world) is under a preternatural attack. We fight with our own, man-made weapons against a pure sprits. We reason with our brains like animals, not with our souls. And we are perpetually hindered and confounded. 

My most direct explanation of our losing strategy, however, was not published on Hennessy's View. The Gateway Pundit graciously allowed me to publish it there, where it would reach his millions of daily visitors.  [**See *Demonic Possession at the Portland Riots*, September 8, 2020**](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2020/09/demonic-possession-portland-riots/)

Now I've begun reading Malachi Martin's *Windswept House*. About fifty pages into the book, I stopped to consider what I had read thus far, and my initial reaction was, *I hope I'm losing my mind*. 

Let's back up a bit and take a quick look at Malachi Martin.

## 3 Important Things to Know about Malachi Martin and *Windswept House*

To understand why this book has shocked me so much, it's important to know three things about Martin Malachi:

1. His life and works (abbreviated mercilessly)
2. His access to people and information
3. His commentary and notes about *Windswept House*

### Short Bio of Martin Malachi

Malachi Martin was Roman Catholic priest, a Jesuit. A fascinating individual. Both modernist and orthodox Catholics are split on whether Martin was a prophet or a grifter. Evidence exists to support both conclusions and from both the modernist (heretical) and orthodox (faithful) points of view. 

For brevity, here's the opening of Martin's Wikipedia entry:

{{< blockquote source="Wikipedia" link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malachi_Martin" >}}
Malachi Brendan Martin (Irish: Maolsheachlainn Breandán Ó Máirtín; 23 July 1921 – 27 July 1999), occasionally writing under the pseudonym Michael Serafian, was an Irish Catholic priest and writer on the Catholic Church. Originally ordained as a Jesuit priest, he became Professor of Palaeography at the Vatican's Pontifical Biblical Institute. From 1958, he served as secretary to Cardinal Augustin Bea during preparations for the Second Vatican Council.

Disillusioned by Vatican II, he asked to be released from certain aspects of his Jesuit vows in 1964 and moved to New York City, where he later became an American citizen.

His 17 novels and non-fiction books were frequently critical of the Vatican hierarchy, who he believed had failed to act on the Third Prophecy revealed by the Virgin Mary at Fátima.[1] Among his most significant works were The Scribal Character of The Dead Sea Scrolls (1958) and Hostage To The Devil (1976) which dealt with Satanism, demonic possession, and exorcism. The Final Conclave (1978) was a warning against Soviet espionage in the Holy See via Soviet spies in the Vatican.

### Martin's Unusual Access to Persons and Information (natural and supernatural)

Martin had access to persons and information not available to your typical Jesuit. As we saw in the Wiki bio, he was secretary to Cardinal Bea at the most critical period of Catholic Church history in the past 200 years, the preparations for Vatican II. In that role, Martin would have had regular interactions with the highest members of the Church hierarchy, as well as major global media the top of government hierarchies in Europe and the Americas. 

Malachi Martin also served as something of a spy for the Vatican throughout much of the Cold War, similar to the way William F. Buckley worked as a CIA agent in Mexico while remaining William F. Buckley. In this role, he mingled with powerful heads of multinational corporations, heads of state, and numerous members of the European Commission (*cum* European Union).

Finally, Malachi Martin was an exorcist who performed hundreds of exorcisms (some famous) in the United States and Europe. (Remember that, after Vatican II, the Church greatly restricted exorcism training for priests. When a bishop needed an exorcist, he was forced to call on any ordained priest with exorcism experience he could find, and Malachi Martin was one such priest. And, since Malachi had been released from his vows, he was often available.)

In the course of an exorcism, exorcists can learn things from demons that are not knowable by any natural means. A sanctioned exorcism allows a priest to command demons to tell the truth. (It's not the priest who has this power, but Jesus Christ working through the priest.) For example, demons have told exorcists what individuals hundreds of miles away were doing at that moment in excruciating detail—confirmed after the exorcism session ends. 

From time to time, demons reveal to exorcists their larger plans—the "Process," if you will. The [MacGuffin](https://thecinemaholic.com/macguffin/) is the Process—the process of shrinking the Catholic Church until it fit into the New World Order's unification "church." 

### *Windswept House* was 85% Fact, According to Martin

We have seen that Malachi Martin had extraordinary access to people and information from the late 1950s into the 1990s. We also know that, as a priest without a priestly obligation, Martin had time the freedom and time pursue multiple interests. He became a writer and something of a media personality. 

In 1996, Martin published *Windswept House: a Vatican Novel*. Most readers considered it pure fiction. But Vatican insiders and Martin knew better. 

Martin called *Windswept House* "faction" and claimed 85 percent of the book is fact. The fictional elements involved changing names to avoid lawsuits, blending numerous persons into a single character, and providing rich dialogue to characters. But the major events and persons in the book, according to its author, reflect actual events and actual persons. 

To demonstrate the factual accuracy of the book, Martin left behind clues to match the book's characters to the actual persons they portray. [See the complete list at Fish Eaters](https://www.fisheaters.com/catholiclibrary-windseptkey.html).)

I call your attention to number 38. Jacques Deneuve (banker) = Klaus Straub, then of the World Trade Organization, now chairman of the World Economic Forum and author of the book, *The Great Reset*

### What Is *The Great Reset?*

Using Klaus Straub's own words:

{{< blockquote author="Klaus Straub" >}}
The Great Reset is a creative industry movement to embed the positive environmental shifts that have happened during lockdown as THE new normal.
{{< /blockquote >}}

More broadly, The Great Reset is intended to:

1. Eliminate all sovereign nations and states, to be replaced by one world government.
2. Meld all world religions into one world religian under the one world government.
3. Centrally manage all aspects of human behavior, knowledge, and desires.

In other words, this is the New World Order that George H.W. Bush talked about during and after Desert Storm.

Supporting this Great Reset are almost every major corporation, most national governments (Russia a notable exception), and the hierarchy of the Catholic Church, especially Jorge Bergoglio (aka, Pope Francis). Additionally, the William and Melinda Gates Foundation, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, Amazon, the Kellogg Foundation, the Ford Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation. (If it ends in "foundation," it's probably supporting the New World Order.)

### Malachi Martin Documented The Great Reset in 1996

When you read *Windswept House* in 2021, you will probably think, as I did, that the Church and the globlists are actually using the book as their blueprint. As if it were their plan all along. 

I can't say *Windswept House* is a prophecy. It's not. It's a plan. It's a secret plan that Martin exposed as a novel to avoid getting murdered. And one of the architects of this plan to abolish national sovereignty and all religions is Klaus Straub, frined of Pope Francis, Bill Gates, and Tony Fauci. 

I'll give you one example. The central story involves the papacy's threat to the globalist's plans. The melding of all religions into one could not happen if Catholics continue to believe Christ is the way, the truth, and the life, and that Christ left a Church to which He entrusted the keys to St. Peter. So long as Catholics believe the Holy Sacraments (baptism, penance, the Eucharist, matrimony, confirmation, holy orders, and extreme unction) are vital to salvation, they'll never agree to give them up to join some United Nations "church." 

At the time, St. John Paul II was pope, and Pope John Paul was anything but a humanist. He was a humanitarian, but not a humanist. John Paul believed strongly in the supernatural and the preternatural. He believed strongly in the messages of Fatima. While he implored Christians to live the Beatitudes, he held to the primacy of Peter, the one true Church of Christ, and the sacred mysteries of the faith. 

In other words, John Paul II was an obstacle to the New World Order. 

So, Vatican hierarchs and their global, secular allies plotted to force the pope to resign. 

In 1996, Catholics and religious scholars considered this "resigantion protocol" the most absurd part of the book, the thing that made it fiction. Almost science fiction. And, of course, Pope John Paul II did not resign. 

But, then, his successor, Pope Benedict XVI, did resign. And Benedict was far more of an obstacle to both Church modernists and secular globalists than John Paul ever was. 

The aburd becomes the sublime. 

### The Enthronement of Lucifer

We've covered a lot of ground in a very short time. We started with an extended quote from *Windswept House*. We talked about the demonic assistance being given to Antifa/BLM rioters in Portland. We took a look at the fascinating Malachi Martin. And we glanced at The Great Reset and its intent to sweep in the New World Order that abolishes all governments but one, all religions, but one, all desires but those authorized by the one world government. 

Those events might seem implausible. Would the United States really give up its sovereignty? It sounds absurd, doesn't it? It sounds as absurd as a pope resigning. 

And here's the key to understanding why I believe the New World Order is going to be a reality. And soon. And I've already mentioned it.

The people pushing the New World Order are fighting a spiritual battle on behalf of demons, while those of us on the other side are mostly fighting a natural battle against flesh and blood. 

**If we don't stop our 'natural' fight and begin fighting, in huge numbers, with power of God, the New World Order is just around the corner**.

One of the criteria the Church uses in discerning demonic possession is unnatural knowledge.
