We will feel sense of smug satisfaction when Joe Biden looks into the camera in the Oval Office and says, "I will resign the presidency effective noon tomorrow." Justice demands Biden's resignation in disgrace. 

But his next words should strike terror in the hearts of man.

"At that time, in this office, Vice President Harris will be sworn in as the forty-seventh President of the United States."

While Joe Biden is famously stupid and arrogant (he cheated his way through law school, plagiarized numerous speeches, and lies about almost everything), he has been around Washington a long time. 

Harris, on the other hand, is an airheaded bimbo who slept her way to prominence. She was a miserable attorney and a worse Senator. Her own Senate Democrat colleagues laughed at her behind her back.

Again, justice demands Biden's shameful resignation, not only for the Afghanistan debacle but for his shameful exploitation of the American system spanning 50 years. But Biden's departure will not bring relief from the demons that oppress the United States. It will, in fact, invite in more and meaner demons.

Folks, we are experiencing a well-deserved chastisement. There is no way out of it except prayer, fasting, and redemptive suffering. The good must continue to accept suffering for the bad. 

If we suffer in union with Christ crucified, we will, at least, please God and store up treasures in heaven. And, perhaps God will cool His wrath a little early. 

In other words, there is no silver bullet. As a nation, we turned our back on God and He departed as we asked. Then the demons rushed in to fill the void. 

God â˜© come to my assistance.
Lord, make haste to help me.

Glory be to the Father,
And to the Son,
And to the Holy Ghost,
As it was in the beginning,
Is now,
And ever shall be.
Amen
