So far, I've resisted the temptation to send "I told ya so" emails to all the people who complained that I was being "negative" for the past three years. 

I started seeing this coming as far back as 2018. At the time, I expected a civil war. Today, I don't expect any serious resistance. The takeover happened too fast. And far too many Americans are too comfortable to risk their material possessions by trying to reclaim the freedoms they've lost. 


### How Did We Lose America So Quickly?

On November 3, 2020, a rigged election prepared the way for America's first true dictator. 

On September 9, 2021, that dictator declared total power. 

By noon on September 10, America's largest corporations vowed their loyalty and obedience to the dictator. 

With terrifying speed, 245 years of self-governance, known as the American Experiment, were erased—flushed down the Memory Hole, to borrow a phrase from *1984*. 

Like most dictators, Emporer Biden has built a case against scapegoats: whites, men, and the unvaccinated. Three scapegoats, all of whom have been or will be excluded from citizenship in the new empire. These scapegoats are now people without nationality, as the nation of their birth no longer exists, and the occupying force has strict rules of citizenship that prohibit their kind. My kind. 

### No One Is Coming to Save You

If you expect someone to ride to your rescue, be warned. 

When the fascists came to power in Germany, Italy, and Japan in the 1930s, they were countered by Russia, the United States, (for a time) France, and Great Britain. Eventually, that alliance conquered the fascists. But who will free the displaced Americans? What nation on earth cares enough about humanity to send its own sons into harm's way to liberate a nation that brought about its own demise? 

If I had to look anywhere for help, it would be Russia. Russia is the only country on earth that can resist China and the American Empire. But Russia has its own issues and is unlikely to come to our aid. 

### I Am Sorry to Have Been (Mostly) Right All Along

Just because I saw this coming doesn't make its realization any less painful. But it's important for us to remind ourselves of how obvious this eventually was months and years ago. 

Let's go back to my first prophetic blog on the topic of a coming American dictatorship in August of 2017. 

On August 10, 2018, I wrote:

I don’t want to get morbid here, but things aren’t going so well if you haven’t noticed. The kinds of people who read this blog are being targeted by Antifa mobs for violence, silenced on Facebook and Twitter, and threatened even by politicians of the Democratic party.

For the time being, President Trump holds our torturers and persecutors at bay. But Trump won’t be president forever. He could be out of office a year from now should the Democrats take over the House and Senate in January.  And, if Trump is impeached and convicted, the future President Pence has little chance of winning in 2020.

We could then fight a bloody civil war. It would be a low-level war fought in small skirmishes. A guerilla war that lasts for decades.

The key point: after Trump, the deluge. 

The deluge has started. But it's only just begun. 

In July of 2020, I saw the end of America as vividly as I saw the sunrise the day I wrote:

{{< blockquote author="Bill Hennessy" link="https://www.hennessysview.com/the-end-of-america/" title="The End of America" >}}
In six years, the present-day United States will find itself in one of three conditions:

- Marxist-totalitarian dictatorship masquerading as the United States.
- Dystopian failed state in a perpetual civil war.
- Divided into at least three distinct countries and functioning more or less successfully.

The reason for this forecast is simple: a large number of Americans have simply decided they no longer wish to be Americans. We will call this group the “defectors.” Let’s call non-defectors “loyalists.”

The key point: America was too divided to stand. 

That division is now irreversable. 

America's iminent demise become undeniable during Lent of 2021. In a series of blog posts, I described what would happen in the coming months. Those posts were *A Hill to Die On*, *This Is What Will Happen*, 

{{< blockquote author="Bill Hennessy" link="https://www.hennessysview.com/a-hill-to-die-on/" title="A Hill to Die On" >}}
The Vaccine Passport is coming. It will be required to travel, yes, but also to transact, to buy or sell online, to hold a bank account, to hold a job. It’s coming.

I unpacked the lion's share of what was to come in [*This Is What Will Happen*](https://www.hennessysview.com/this-is-what-will-happen/). This long post (over 3,500 words) predicted four major events:

1. Vaccine mandates.
2. Vaccinated conservatives turning against the unvaccinated.
3. Persecution and internal exile of the unvaccinated.
4. Establishment of an agrearian shadow cultore by the unvaccinated.

On stage 3, persecution and exile, I saw four steps:

1. Private companies barring the unvaccinated customers, particularly in travel.
2. Employer-driven vaccine mandates because of government inducements.
3. Deprivation of commerce, even online, without a vaccine passport.
4. Landlords and HOAs expelling the unvaccinated. 

You probably realize that all but the last of these steps is underway. Steps one, two, and three are happening simultaneously right now. Apartment complexes are already requiring proof of vaccination for new tenants, so number 4 won't be far behind. 

Next, I saw the need to tell people "do not comply." I believe there's a *chance* the vaccine passport could be the mark of the beast from the Book of Revelation. Even if it's not, the passport symbolizes one's preference for this world over the Kingdom of God. The post *Vaccine Passports and Tributes to Roman Gods* told the story of early Christians who rationalized paying public tributes to Roman Gods in order to be left alone. 

{{< blockquote author="AUTHOR" link="LINK" title="TITLE" >}}
So it was that, amidst a century of decline, the Roman emperor Decius decided to end the Christian problem once and for all. He required everyone in the empire to pay a one-time public tribute to a Roman god.

Decius set up a distribution system for the tributes so that citizens and non could walk up to a table in a marketplace and offer a libation to the god of their choice, free of charge.

“Then you’d get a little certificate with your name on it saying that you had been seen making a sacrifice to the gods, signed by official witnesses."[^1]

Did the early Christians eschew this act of apotacy? Many did, but many did not. Many Christians reasoned that the “sacrifice” was such a small token, God wouldn’t really mind. They had families to care for and businesses to run, and people dependent on them. It would be silly, they thought, to be beheaded or thrown to the lions over such a silly little thing.
