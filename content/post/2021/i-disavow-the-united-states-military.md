After watching a 4-star general declare war on his fellow citizens, I decided to disassociate myself from the US military. I consider the US military an enemy of the principles on which this country was founded, an enemy of freedom, and an enemy of God. Therefore, I must completely disassociate from the military. 

### Disavow Defined

Before you go too crazy, please consider what it means to disavow something. Let's look at definitions of the word from a few sources.

Merriam-Webster gives two definitions of "disavow":

1. To deny responsibility for: REPUDIATE
2. To refuse to acknowledge or accept: DISCLAIM

American Heritage Dictionary offers slightly different definitions:

1. To disclaim knowledge of, responsibility for, or association with 
2. To assert to be wrong or of little value

I apply all four of the above definitions when it comes to the Department of Defense and all its nefarious tentacles. I want no association with the beast headed by the unhinged man of privilege and entitlement, General Mark Milley. I deny any responsibility for anything the US military does from this moment forward. I believe that in the battle of good vs. evil, God vs. Satan, individualism vs. collectivism, that the US military is of little value and mostly wrong—wrong morally, intellectually, and behaviorally.

As a US military veteran, I do not disavow my service, nor do I disavow the value of the organization I belonged to. We fought the Cold War under the ocean, and we won, thanks be to God and Ronald Reagan. 

Nor to I disavow or denegrate current members of the armed forces below the paygrade O-7. Sure, there are some jerks in the ranks—there always are—but the DoD's evil intent is not for the junior officers and enlisted members to decide. When push comes to shove, I suspect most of the members would refuse to kill their fellow citizens, their brothers and sisters, and their parents. (At least, I hope so.)

What I disavow is the Pentagon today and its civilian and uniformed leadership. 

Sometime between the Gipper's departure from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue and Donald Trump's return to Mara Lago, the US military became a force for evil. The Department of Defense serves exclusively the interests of globalists who want to destroy national sovereignty and borders, abolish private property, and subject every human to bondage to elites. 

Any organization that relies on violence or threats of violence to advance anti-human objectives on behalf of powerful, godless individuals or organizations is something I want nothing to do with. And, sadly, the United States Armed Forces have become just such a fascist, murderous entity. 

The practical effects of my disavowal will be minimal. I won't participate in any Veteran's Day activities. I won't petition for any veterans' benefits. I won't renew my American Legion membership. I won't stand when veterans are asked to stand. Again, I don't deny my service, but I won't create a scandal by being associated with an institution that opposes God and hates Jesus Christ. 

So, I disavow the United States military as wholeheartedly as I disavow communism and Nazism and Satanism. They are simply different aspects of the same evil. 

### The US Military Wants Us Dead

Glenn Greenwald, a longtime enemy of the military, offers a sobering analysis of General Milley's deceitful motivation.

[Describing the Pentagon's policy of endless war, Greenwald notes](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/what-is-behind-gen-mark-milleys-righteous?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMjQ0NDAzNCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MzgwMzY0NDksIl8iOiIwQXlWRCIsImlhdCI6MTYyNDcwNzc3MSwiZXhwIjoxNjI0NzExMzcxLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMTI4NjYyIiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.VyemJEnapuXSTST0N4eMQuNWYOPNTa3TRp_waJ9TXok):

> The post-WW2 military posture of the US has been endless war. To enable that, there must always be an existential threat, a new and fresh enemy that can scare a large enough portion of the population with sufficient intensity to make them accept, even plead for, greater military spending, surveillance powers, and continuation of permanent war footing. Starring in that war-justifying role of villain have been the Communists, Al Qaeda, ISIS, Russia, and an assortment of other fleeting foreign threats.

Greenwald explains that the Pentagon, all the US intel services, and the Biden Administration speak in a unified voice on the only remaining threat to the United States: domestic extremism. Specifically, "white rage." 

> In other words, to justify the current domestic War on Terror that has already provoked billions more in military spending and intensified domestic surveillance, **the Pentagon must ratify the narrative that those they are fighting in order to defend the homeland are white supremacist domestic terrorists**. That will not work if white supremacists are small in number or weak and isolated in their organizing capabilities. **To serve the war machine's agenda, they must pose a grave, pervasive and systemic threat**.

In other words, white Americans are to Mark Milley what Jews were to Hitler: the scapegoats, the inferior race, the rats. 

And the US military will exterminate us to advance its ends. 

### You've Been Warned

In the past week, Joe Biden experienced a rare moment of clarity. He, perhaps accidentally, told us just how far he is willing to go to exterminate us: F-18s and nuclear missiles. 

Never in US history has a president threatened to nuke Americans. Don't assume Biden was anything but serious about this. Timed to coincide with Gen. Milley's declaration of war on "white rage," whatever that is, I would take Biden's words as more than just a warning. They seem to indicate a plan. Or, perhaps, a promise to his voters. "We will eliminate the people you hate." 

### Am I Paranoid?

Maybe. Maybe not. 

The US military is the most potent killing machine ever created. It can wipe out cities in seconds. 

For most of US history, our military power helped us sleep at night. Developed chiefly during World War II, that force stopped the last great spasm of evil that sought to subdue human freedom. 

Evil loves power, and it's only natural that evil would want to control the incredible power of the US military. 

I've written long about the way demons work, according to the most experienced exorcists in the world. No one is exempt from demonic influence, and demons offer incredible worldly power to those who will listen. Don't believe me? 

> The devil led him up to a high place and showed him in an instant all the kingdoms of the world. And he said to him, "I will give you all their authority and splendor; it has been given to me, and I can give it to anyone I want to. If you worship me, it will all be yours." (Luke 4:5-7)

If Luke isn't enough, here's what Matthew had to say:

> Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor. "All this I will give you," he said, "if you will bow down and worship me." (Matthew 4:8-9)

Do you think Satan would not tempt Mark Milley? 

Do you think Mark Milley, a man of privilege and entitlement, would say, like Christ, "Away from me, Satan?" 



### The Department of Defense Is a Clear and Present Danger to You and Your Family

Glenn Greenwald closes out [his excellent essay](https://greenwald.substack.com/p/what-is-behind-gen-mark-milleys-righteous?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMjQ0NDAzNCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MzgwMzY0NDksIl8iOiIwQXlWRCIsImlhdCI6MTYyNDcwNzc3MSwiZXhwIjoxNjI0NzExMzcxLCJpc3MiOiJwdWItMTI4NjYyIiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.VyemJEnapuXSTST0N4eMQuNWYOPNTa3TRp_waJ9TXok) with two sobering paragraphs that convinced me of two things:

1. I am not paranoid.
2. I must publicly and unequivocally disavow the United States military. 

First, Greenwald explains precisely the Pentagon's latest enemy: you and me.

> **The Pentagon's prime targets, by their own statements, are sectors of the US population** that they regard as major threats to the national security of the United States. Embracing theories that depict "white rage" and white supremacy as the source of domestic instability and violence is not just consistent with but necessary for advancing that mission. Put another way, the doctrine of the US intelligence and military community is based on race and ideology, and it should therefore be unsurprising that the worldview promoted by top generals is racialist in nature as well.

Then, Greenwald paints a clear picture of just how evil the military is:

> Whatever else is true, it is creepy and tyrannical to try to place military leaders and their pronouncements about war off-limits from critique, dissent and mockery. No healthy democracy allows military officials to be venerated to the point of residing above critique. That is especially true when their public decrees are central to the **dangerous attempt to turn the war posture of the US military inward to its own citizens**.

Thus, I disavow the United States military.
