The more people say I'm crazy, the more the government tries to prove I'm sane. 

Last week, I told you that [the United States government will begin forcing unvaccinated Americans into internment camps](https://www.hennessysview.com/internment-camps/) by Christmas. **Expect popular support for internment camps to show up in polls starting in September or October** when the Lambda Variant takes hold. (Even though Lambda appears to be utterly resilient to vaccinations, the "experts" will, of course, blame the unvaccinated.) 

### You and I Are on DHS's Hit List

The psychological operations to enlist popular support for interning American citizens began this week as if on queue.

The Department of Homeland Security issued a warning of imminent terrorist attacks as we approach the 20th anniversary of 9-11. Unlike past alerts, however, this warning was about American citizens. Specifically, conservative, liberty-minded Americans:

{{< figure src="/images/terrorists.png" caption="DHS wants you to turn in anyone who objects to COVID restrictions, believes in voter fraud, or honors religious holidays." title="DHS: How to Spot a Domestic Terrorist" >}}

The DHS has asked the public's help in identifying family, friends, and acquaintances who fit the profile of potential terrorists. 

Additionally, the government and media have shifted their language regarding anti-terrorism efforts. In addition to considering people like me the most dangerous threats facing America, they also talk exclusively about removing those deemed to have the *potential* for violence from society. And those with the most potential for violence, according to the government, are, in order of threat:

1. Those opposed to COVID mandates.
2. Those who believe fraud tainted the 2020 election.
3. Those who talk about 9/11 or observe religious holidays.

### Missouri Governors Calls for "Dividing" Unvaccinated from Society

Perhaps most concerning news to Missourians like myself is the fact that [Governor Mike Parson is now calling for "dividing" the unvaccinated from the rest of society](https://www.facebook.com/525787999/posts/10159805397548000/?).

{{< figure src="/images/parson-unvax.png" caption="'I think there needs to be a DIVISION between those people [who have been vaccinated or recovered from COVID] and the people who are unvaccinated." title="Gov. Parson Calls for 'Division' of the Unvaccinated in Missouri" >}}
 
Do you understand what this means? In the reddest of red states with a Republican governor, you will be "divided" from society should choose, for any reason, to remain unvaccinated against COVID and only against COVID. 

Having met Parson when he was a Senator, I can confirm two things about him:

1. Mike Parson is in politics to get rich.
2. Except for his unique skill number 1, Mike Parson is the original box of rocks that nothing is dumber than.

Parson has no political ideology. He supports or opposing nothing on principle. Instead, Parson's support or opposition to any issue is based exclusively on how it affects his personal finances and power. As one former State Senator who served in the legislature with Parson said, "He will sell everything that isn't nailed down." 

And Parson isn't alone among GOP governors. Perhaps we can trust DeSantis and Noem to resist the federal internment of their citizens. But I see no evidence the other Republican governors will not cave to internment camps once the US government gangles a few hundred million dollars before their eyes. Or when Soros promises to buy a million copies of their incoherent autobiographies ghost-written in a week by a grad student. 

If you believe your friends and colleagues will not turn you in, you are sorely mistaken. Already, workplaces are full of gossip about those who might not be vaccinated. The victims of this gossip are easy to spot: they eat lunch alone day after day. For more information on how the media and government are psychologically manipulating your friends to turn on you, [read last week's post](https://www.hennessysview.com/internment-camps/). 

Therefore, if you are one of those who is committed to declining the vaccination for any reason, be prepared. Have a place to hide or be ready for life in the camps. 

### Do Not Put Hope in Man

If you still hope that America will wake up and reverse course, your hope is misguided and will lead you to be unprepared. 

It seems that only divine intervention will spare us. **And that's why our only hope is in God through Jesus Christ**. So, if you have not spent at least 30 minutes on your knees in prayer today, please stop and do so now. Pray for America's awakening, sure, but don't count on that. **Pray, instead, for your perseverance and fortitude to remain Christian throughout the chastisement that is just beginning**. 

*Adiutórium nóstrum {{< text-color color="red" text="☩" >}} in nómine Dómini.*  
*Qui fecit cælum et terram.*

*Mary, Queen of Victories, pray for us*
