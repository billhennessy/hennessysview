"The Bigs" include Big Agriculture, Big Pharma, Big Medicine, and, of course, Big Government. These malfeasant monsters get a lot of help from Big Tech, which silences dissent and demands conformity to the Bigs' "approved" beliefs.

But the Bigs care nothing for your health and wellbeing. **The Bigs look for ways to increase the prevalence of chronic conditions and diseases**. 

On June 14, I wrote about [the spiritual dimensions of keeping your body as healthy as possible](https://www.hennessysview.com/god-needs-you-strong-body-mind-soul/). Today, we're going to talk about how non-traditional approaches to metabolic health can poke the Bigs in the eyeballs. And we all like that, don't we?

### It's Not Longevity, but vitality

I know this sounds bad, but I don't care if you or I live longer. **I want us to live *fully* and *vibrantly* for however long God leaves us in this exile on earth**. 

I want to avoid the sick-aging phenotype defined as:

- Obesity
- Frailty 
- Limited mobility
- Constant or frequent pain and discomfort
- Polypharmacy (more than one long-term prescription for chronic conditions)
- Metabolic syndrome (downward spiral of tissue and organs due to chronic inflammation)

My dad, who died at age 95 earlier this year, avoided sick-aging syndrome. He was active, and he ate a high-fat diet. His mind stayed sharp for 95 years!

My mom, who died at age 93 in 2017, spent the last seven years of her life in the memory support section of a nursing homeâ€”Alzheimer's. For the previous seven-year, my dad was her home-care provider and guardian. Mom lived on sugar. Though she was thin, she ate almost nothing but carbohydrates. 

If you looked at my mom's diet, she was the poster child of the "healthy" diet pushed on Americans by doctors, dietitians, and, especially, the Food and Drug Administration since the late 1960s. And she acquired one of the chronic, deadly diseases that the Bigs knowingly pushed on Americans for half a century. 

I want to live out my years like my dad, not like my mom. My guess is that you do, too. 

### The FDA and Doctors Stole 15 Year of My Mother's Life 

Doctors and the government have been lying to us about healthy eating since the 1960s. You know that as well as I do. And if you don't, here are some of the posts I've written on the subject in the past:

* [Government Diet Makes You Fat and Kills You](https://www.hennessysview.com/2017/02/08/government-diet-makes-you-fat-and-kills-you/)
* [Why Are You Letting Your Doctor Kill You?](https://www.hennessysview.com/2017/02/05/why-are-you-letting-your-doctor-kill-you/)
* [How to Hold Your Breath for 3 Minutes](https://www.hennessysview.com/2017/01/29/how-to-hold-your-breath-for-3-minutes/)
* [Study: Kellogg's Deadlier Than Cigarettes](https://www.hennessysview.com/2016/12/02/study-kelloggs-products-deadlier-than-cigarettes/)

The FDA's recommended diet, including all its revisions, was designed to sell grains and to create customers for the medical and pharmaceutical industries. With those goals in mind, the FDA food pyramids and grids were the most successful marketing campaigns in history. 

Look at this chart of chronic diseases in the United States from 2007 to 2017:

{{< figure src="/images/chronic-diseases-95.png" caption="Prevalence of chronic diseases in the US grew by 30% from 1995 to 2020. By 2030, over half of the US population is expected to acquire at least one chronic illness unless they change their diets dramatically." >}}

And here's how chronic conditions grew among the Medicare population in just 10 years from 2007 to 2017.

{{< figure src="/images/chronic-disease-07-22.png" >}}

And that's just 2007 to 2017. Obesity, Type II diabetes, heart disease, cancer, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's were already considered epidemics by 2007. In fact, Americans have grown fatter and sicker every year since 1970, about the time the federal government began telling us what to eat and in what quantities. 

Charitably, we could say the government and doctors weren't lying; they were just providing erroneous but honest recommendations. 

I call BS for two reasons:

1. If the government and doctors were wrong about everything involving diet and health for 50 years, then they're amazingly stupid and incompetent. But we're told government healthcare researchers are the smartest people in the world. So it can't be incompetence. 
2. Dedicated doctors who ignore the "best practices" and the "approved" treatments of their industry save lives every day through **non-traditional approaches to chronic disease cure and prevention**. (Yes, I said cure. What I am about to tell you has been proven to cure Type II diabetes, cancer, dementia, heart disease, and numerous other "incurable" chronic conditions and diseases.) The data from these doctors have been available for years, but the FDA, CDC, NIH, research universities, the AMA, the major peer-reviewed medical journals, corporate doctors, and the media ignore them. 


Why does Big Medicine ignore life-saving science? **Because there's not much money in disease prevention and cure**. The money is in disease proliferation and protraction. The longer the patient suffers, the more money for the system. 

I'm starting a crusade to eliminate or greatly reduce the prevalence of chronic, non-infectious diseases among my friends. I don't care if Big Medicine continues to profit from killing people. I can't control them, and I don't want to. I can only control what I do, and I am going to arm you with the information and tools to live the rest of your life with vitality if you join me. 

Over the next two weeks, I will prepare you for a journey to feeling the best you've ever felt in your life. In six months, your doctor will look at your blood test results and ask you what you've been doing to improve so dramatically.

If you are overweight, you will lose weight. If you are a Type II diabetic, you will probably be off medication. If you have joint pain today, you'll have less of it in six months. Maybe no pain at all. If you're tired all the time, you will have energy in abundance. 

Do you get hungry throughout the day? You won't be hungry soon. What I am going to share will make hunger a thing of the past. You'll eat, but you won't feel you *must* eat. You will find yourself *accidentally* skipping meals and feeling no different than if you'd eaten. You might even forget to eat all day from time to time. I know I do. 

I won't try to replicate all the great work from those dedicated doctors I told you about. Instead, I will provide some extended quotes from their books, some of their videos, and links to their blogs. But I urge you to buy and read the books I recommend. You need to know how your body works to understand why certain dietary practices are absolutely essential to your health and vitality. Don't *assume* you know how this works. Read the books. Follow the program. 

More to follow. Stay tuned . . .
