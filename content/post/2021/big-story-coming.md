### Why Haven't I Been Writing?

My buddy Ed Martin called me out for not writing enough. Ed is right, and he's not alone. Others have asked why I'm not writing as often. 

{{< figure src="/images/ed-martin.jpg" caption="A gratutous headshot of Ed Martin (for the ladies)" >}}

The short story is: 

1. I am writing a lot, I'm just not posting a lot. Sometimes I lose interest in the subject of my post before I get to a logical conclusion. Sometimes the writing, the story, just sucks. And sometimes, I work on big articles that require a lot of research, contemplation, prayer, and revision. 
2. I've been working an average of 60 hours a week for the past few months, so I'm pretty worded-out by the end of the day. (And my work days increasing start immediately after morning prayers at 6:00.)
3. My diet has gotten out of whack with too many carbohydrates, not enough fat, and too much alcohol. (More about that later this week.)

So, I thought I'd share with you a sponsaneous rant I posted to Gab earlier today. (FYI, if you miss me, follow me on Gab. Link in the footer.) I wrote it, in part, because I'm shocked that so many people are shocked that the government and medicine would endanger their lives with lies, cover-ups, and bad science. (Hint: whatever the government tells you to do healthwise, do the exact opposite, always, without question.)

I hope this tides you over while I finish a Big Story about **The New World Order, the Great Reset, the pope, and everybody's favorite: DEMONS**. (Yes, they're all related.) Enjoy!

## Americans Are Killing Themselves and Don't Even Know It

I am going to exhort you to read a book, in a moment. But first, Americans are killing themselves with their diet, and they don't even know it. 

Worse, they are setting themselves up for a miserable second half of life.

It's not their fault. **The government and doctors have been lying to us for decades.**

The government, doctors, pharma, and certain food lobbyists. Setting you up to die after 15-20 years of living like an invalid—a dozen expensive prescriptions, aches, pains, chronic diseases, low energy (Jeb!), mental decline, obesity, cancer, heart disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimers, diabetes. That's a short list of what the FDA recommended diet is intended to produce.

But **you can pull a one-eighty on the path to fat, sloppy misery and early death.** Here's how:

[Read *ketoCONTINUUM* by Dr. Annette Bosworth](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08RWG34T7?&amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;tag=drboz-20&amp;linkId=c9f44cf26c33300c38db62ea6ddd3376&amp;language=en_US&amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl). This is so important, I'm breaking my rule and sending you to Amazon. 

Don't let the FDA, AMA, and lobbyist ruin your life. And if you have kids, you've been warned. If a parent doesn't teach their kids how to eat, they're guilty of child abuse. 

Read the book today. Please.It's important. 

We need strong, healthy, resilient patriots to fight both the Great War on both the worldy and spiritual planes. Sickly, obese pharmaceutical addicts will not Make America Great Again. And the good news is, you can get strong, healthy, and resilient by eating your favorite foods:

* Bacon
* Pork Sausage (yum!)
* Eggs, eggs, and more eggs - both ONLY with the yoke. (Throw in an extra yoke and throw away the white.)
* Delicious avacados
* Olives
* Beef
* Chicken wings with hot sause, skin and bones included. (Never, never, never eat the boneless kind.)
* MORE!

Dr. Bosworth breaks it all down for you like no one has to date (and I read EVERYTHING about this subject). 

BONUS: Dr. Bosworth must read my blog, because she talks about this approach to eating lets you [**hold your breath for three minutes!**](https://www.hennessysview.com/2017/01/29/how-to-hold-your-breath-for-3-minutes/) Just like a Navy SEAL.

Get the book. I'll give you 2 days to read. Get the workbook, too. It'll save your life, make you look and feel 100% better, and give you more focused energy than you've ever had. **Start planning your escape from the death spiral** the FDA, Big Medicine, Big Pharma, and Big Ag planned for you. 

**NO MORE INFLAMMATION!!**


### BONUS: Another, Related Gab Rant (yours FREE for reading this deep)

**How the Government, Big Medicine, and Big Food Doubled Heart Disease**

Earlier, I posted about how the "authorities" (the FDA, AMA, etc.) drove the current epidemics in obesity, heart disease, cancer, Alzheimer's, a dozen other chronic, deadly diseases. Here's one example of the 50-year campaign to kill us all for profit.

Trans Fats (and vegetable oils in general)

Trans fats were invented in Germany in the early 1900s. They're vegetable oils infused with hydrogen to make them solid at room temperature. Why did that matter? The served as a very cheap replacement for tallow (beef fat) and lard (pork fat). And much cheaper than king of such things, rendered duck fat.

Example: margarine (oleo) is cheaper than butter.

Next, the demand for trans fats provided a new market for growers and processors of oily vegetables. This meant a new lobby to influence government.

Now, the grain and fruit side of Big Ag has always been a more aggressive lobby than Big Beef or Big Pork. The agriculture lobby went to work, pressuing the FDA to declare lard and tallow "dangerous." They used the (false and unscientific) cholesterol scare as cover. The FDA and Big Medicine pushed consumers to drop butter for margarine, lard for Crisco.

By the 1970s, the word "fat" triggered more panic than COVID did in 2020. A plethora of "fat-free" products hit the store shelves. "Zero fat", "97% fat-free!" If you were alive in the 1970s or 1980s, you remember. 

The indoctrination and propaganda were so successful, most adults today will panic if you say "high-fat diet." So will most doctors.

But the fact is, cholesterol is good and necessary. Very necessary. Fat is necessary. Carbohydrates kill. Inflammation kills. If you don't understand the way the body uses carbohydrates, fats, and protein, you shouldn't eat until you find out. (Hint: you must understand mitochondria and the liver.)

It turns out, **as early as the 1970s, strong evidence emerged that trans fats, and vegetable oils in general, are far more deadly than any animal fat**. According to Dr. Annette Bosworth MD in her latest book, ketoCONTINUUM:

> Case in point: margarine and Crisco. Our body cannot make these fats; therefore the amount of trans-fats measured in the lining of the red blood cells directly correlates to how many trans fats were eaten over the past three months. Once the cell lining has been assembled using these fats, the lipids stay there for the lifetime of the cell. Cakes, cookies, pies, and pastries were responsible for the highest amount of trans-fats, followed by yeast-breads, french fries, and tortilla chips. Eat foods with these fats today and find the exact lipids stuck in the lining of your red blood cells 90 days from now.[^1]

Under pressure from consumer advocates, **the FDA did what the FDA does and covered up the science**. They accepted industry studies that showed trans fats were completely safe, safer than animal fats. "Nothing to see here."

But nothing could be further from the truth.

The FDA lied. So did most doctors and nutritionists. Trans fats kill, so do corn oil, canola oil, and most other veggie oils. Demand tallow or lard. (If you haven't had eggs fried in tallow or duck fat, you haven't really had eggs.)

Finally, in the 1990s, the FDA reversed itself—under mounting deaths—and banned trans fats in foods. No one went to jail, of course, but millions died too soon, developed cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinsons, and diabetes because the FDA and the rest of that crooked, greedy bunch lied to make some multinational corporations rich. 

The bottom line on health authorities from the FDA to the CDC to the NIH: **They. Don't. Care. About. You.**

Read the book and live the plan.
