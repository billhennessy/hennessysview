Breaking news this Sunday. In Georgia, the facility housing ballots and equipment for the upcoming audit and recanvass have been broken into. See [The Gateway Pundit for details](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/05/breaking-alarm-went-off-secure-building-fulton-county-georgia-ballots-kept-building-found-wide-open/).

Meanwhile, the Windham, New Hampshire, audit has been taken over by the very people who cheated in November. Again, [The Gateway Pundit has more](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/05/new-hampshire-wake-shady-characters-carrying-shady-activities-elections/).

Now, it's up to us to turn the tide by recognizing, humbly, we can do nothing. Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood. 

**Those who rigged the election are getting preternatural help in concealing their treasonous crimes**.  Human efforts to expose the cockroaches and rats to sunlight will not be enough.

Please take a moment, right now, to pray a prayer for deliverance. Call on the forces of heaven to combat the prince of this world. God bless you for your devotion, and God have mercy on those who've fallen in with the enemy, as we ask the Father in Jesus' name:

### Psalm 53
Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me in thy strength.
O God, hear my prayer: give ear to the words of my mouth.
For strangers have risen up against me; and the mighty have sought after my soul: and they have not set God before their eyes.
For behold God is my helper: and the Lord is the protector of my soul.
Turn back the evils upon my enemies; and cut them off in thy truth.
I will freely sacrifice to thee, and will give praise, O God, to thy name: because it is good:
For thou hast delivered me out of all trouble: and my eye hath looked down upon my enemies.

Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, * and to the Holy Ghost.
As it was in the beginning, is now, * and ever shall be, world without end. Amen.

### Deliverence Prayer for Audits and Recounts

Lord Jesus Christ, in your love and mercy establish a perimeter of protection around election audit centers in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and around ourselves and all our loved ones, those who pray for us and their loved ones, and those conducting the audits. May the Holy Angels guard us and all our possessions, establishing a perimeter of protection around us, the auditors, and the ballots and equipment, rendering us and them immune from any kind of demonic influence. I ask that any demons that should try to come against us or the audit process be rendered deaf, dumb, and blind; that You would strip them of all weapons, armor, power, illusions, and authority; that You would bind, rebuke and disable them from communicating or interacting with each other in any way. Remove them, sending them directly to the foot of Thy Cross. Jesus, Son of the Most High, I ask this in Thy Glorious and Most Holy Name.

R. Amen

*Ad majorem Dei gloriam*
