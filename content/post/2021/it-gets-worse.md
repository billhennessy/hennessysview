On Tuesday, The Gateway Pundit reported that Missouri State Senator Dave Schatz (R-Villa Ridge) was the chief proponent of the largest gasoline tax increase in Missouri history. Schatz's private company, Schatz Underground LLC of Villa Ridge, Missouri, stands to make millions from road construction resulting from that tax hike.

([Read *As Gas Prices Soar, One Missouri Senator Stands to Make Millions from the Gasoline Tax Hike He Demanded*](https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2021/05/gas-prices-soar-one-missouri-senator-stands-make-millions-gasoline-tax-hike-demanded/))

TGP also reported that Schatz used his power as president *pro tempore* of the Senate to block all legislation in the final weeks of the 2021 legislative session unless the gas tax passed. 

Schatz also included a sham rebate in that gas tax hike to **circumvent Missouri's Hancock Amendment**. The Hancock Amendment requires tax increases to go to a vote of the people, the taxpayers. By including the rebate, which places onerous burdens on citizens like saving all gasoline receipts for a year, Schatz broke the spirit of the law. He knew the people would not support the largest gasoline tax hike in state history. 

The gas tax increase will disproportionately affect the poor who will pay a higher percentage of their income for transportation. It will also increase the price of goods and services in Missouri, as businesses will pass along higher costs to consumers. Everybody loses except Dave Schatz. 

In the closing days of the session, [Rep. Jered Taylor took to the House Floor](https://www.facebook.com/OnTheRecordMissouri/videos/4049171175141824/) to expose Schatz's dictatorial plot.

Rep. Taylor courageously offered his amendment, anyway, as seen in the clip. 


### Schatz Strong-Armed Carve-Outs for His Private Company

Now, we've learned that Schatz also demanded "carve-outs" in three pieces of legislation for his company, Schatz Underground LLC. 

**Schatz forced carve-outs for Schatz Underground LLC** in three bills affecting Missouri's utility laws. In other words, Schatz directly legislated business for himself, unfairly freezing out competition and preventing bids. This is a rip-off for all Missouri taxpayers, but the crooked move specifically harms companies competitors of Schatz Underground. 


### Updates on Gas Tax Increase

The Gateway Pundit article said Schatz's Gas Tax increase was 40 percent, but according to one Missouri State Senator, the right way to compute the gas tax increase is to take the increase divided by the original tax which comes to **a 71 percent increase in gasoline taxes**. How will that affect your summer vacation?

Also, we learned that the tax increase is expected to raise $513 million by 2025, making Schatz's Gas Tax the biggest tax increase in Missouri history, period. 

And a lot of that $513 million will go straight into Dave Schatz's back pocket.

Schatz, of course, will **funnel some of that money back to his political cronies**. Lieutenant Govern Kehoe, who's been quietly lobbying for the tax increase for years, wants to be governor someday. Schatz will likely reward him. And House Majority Leader Dean Plocher, who wants to be Speaker, will also have his hand out. Ploecher quietly supported the gas tax increase in the House.

But we can stop this gravy train. 

### Demand a Vote of the People

Missourians have filed a [referendum petition](https://www.sos.mo.gov/CMSImages/Elections/Petitions/2022-R001.pdf) with the Missouri Secretary of State's office to put the gas tax to a vote of the people. 

You can speak your mind about this referendum on the largest ~~gas~~ tax increase in state history during the public comment period:

> The public comment period, pursuant to Section 116.334, RSMo, allows Missourians to offer their observations on the submitted proposal online, by mail or phone. **Missourians can provide comment at [http://www.sos.mo.gov/referendumcomment](http://www.sos.mo.gov/referendumcomment).** 

Let them know you believe Schatz's bill circumvented the intent of the Hancock Amendment, and you want to have your say about this crippling tax increase for Missouri.
