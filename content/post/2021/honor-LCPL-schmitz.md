Let's make sure Missouri hero, Lance Corporal Jared Schmitz of Wentzville, Missouri, receives a proper salute for his sacrifice. LCPL Schmitz USMC was killed in the terror attack at Kabul airport on Thursday. He was a few weeks shy of his 21st birthday. 

Let's cover every overpass and line every street with US and USMC flags. I will update this post with details when they are known.

**Missouri State Rep. Dottie Bailey has secured a Missouri Highway Patrol honor escort for the remains of LCPL Jared Schmitz of Wentzville**. Details to follow. Please watch https://gab.com/whennessy and http://hennessysview.com or Rep. Bailey's Facebook for details. And, please, try to man an overpass or line a street with US and Marine Corps flags. 

Joe Biden couldn't be bothered to receive the fallen at Dover AFB, so we have to make sure these heroes receive the honors they deserve. 

**UPDATE 8/30 8:00 AM:** Still awaiting news on when LCPL Schmitz will return to Missouri. We will keep you posted when we learn more. 

P.S. Missourians rallied in Wentzville this morning on short notice to thank LCPL Schmitz for his devotion and sacrifice.
