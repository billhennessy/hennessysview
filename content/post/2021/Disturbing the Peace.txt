Disturbing the Peace

Perhaps favorite blessing of the Traditional Latin Mass is the peace and quiet, particularly at the Daily Mass. One finds himself praying and at peace in Christ. 

Now comes the pope to disturb even that. 

I noticed today to at Mass, in myself and in the comportment of all I could see, a fidgetiness similar to what one sees at the *Novus Ordo*. 

Praise Jesus that we were allowed to attend Mass today, that our archbishop has not, yet, abrogated the Mass of the Ages in our archdiocese. 

But we have no idea what the future holds, which explains the fidgetiness. Not even the peace of Christ in the tabernacle and sanctuary can escape the pope's will to disturb, disrupt, and sully the sacred. 

God, have mercy on him. He must be very disturbed and angry. I pray the pope finds the peace that he stole from us. Someone might as well enjoy it.
