Trouble losing weight?

Obesity is the number cause of poor health and miserable life quality in the United States. Just read this description of the lives of many middle-age Americans. It is from _The Barbell Prescription_ by Dr. Jonathon Sullivan and Andy Baker:

> He’s a fiend for Domino’s Pizza and Doritos. He likes to cook with frozen ingredients and a microwave. His bodyfat is through the roof – he’s about 48% fat by weight – and he tips the scale at 283, about 70 lbs on his twin brother. He doesn’t like doctors, although he’s known to make frequent trips to the ER for chest pain, fatigue, sore joints, or a skin infection. He hasn’t had a real erection since the start of the Obama Administration. He has Type 2 diabetes, arthritis, messed-up serum lipids, and high blood pressure. He doesn’t know it yet, but he also has a ticking time bomb in his left anterior descending coronary artery. Three years from now, this lesion will clamp off the blood flow to Phil’s left ventricle in the middle of a Die Hard movie marathon. He’ll breathe his last in the cardiac ICU 6 weeks later, age 58.[^1]
