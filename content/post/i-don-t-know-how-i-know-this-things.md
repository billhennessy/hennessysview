You might think I'm all doom and gloom. You might think I've given up.

You'd be wrong, but partially right.

America is doomed.

If you want me to say, "America's best days are ahead of us," you'll be disappointed. America's best days are in the rearview mirror. Your kids and your grandchildren are going to have the kinds of lives you read about. America is doomed.

How do I know this? I don't know. But I do. I do.

If you're still hanging onto the sin of optimism, consider just two posts that scrolled across my Gab feed in about 5 minutes.

That's reality.

It's not like anyone in America was fooled by the election. No one was. Everyone knows that everyone knows that Donald Trump smoked Joe Biden.

And everyone knows that everyone knows that no one will do a damn thing about the coup that put Biden in the White House.

Then, there's this.

The electoral college is going away and with it the voice of people outside of New York, California, and Illinois. You will be a serf, and so will your children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Join these bits of optimistic news the bills introduced in Congress yesterday to expand the Supreme Court to 13 (Last Supper) justices. And age limits on justice to force Alito and Thomas off the bench.

And it's going to happen because there's nothing to stop it.

This is going to sound harsh, but someone has to tell you. Your tweets won't stop what's coming. Nor will your online petitions. Your strongly worded letters are meaningless, as are state laws vowing to resist federal gun control laws. If Facebook hasn't canceled you, it means your rants are futile. (Everybody who actually has influence has already been banned.)

Elect local leaders? Whatever. They own the vote-counting system. If someone is allowed to win, it means either that person is compromised or powerless.

America is

* Over.
* Done.
* Caput.
* Room temperature.
* Dead as a doornail.
* Past tense.
* History.
* Relic.

And we deserve it. As a nation, we deserve it. I know you, dear reader, live an orderly, good life, but you belong to a perverted, sick, evil society. And you and I celebrated and sponsored America's sickness and depravity for years.

Hollywood has been a cesspool since the 20s, but most of us have paid to watch a movie, either in a theatre, cable, or streaming, in the past year. Do you still pay Netflix? Do you still pay Charter? ATT? Do you still provide page views and content to Twitter and Facebook, and Instagram? (You are the product they sell, don't you know?)

Do you still drink Coke? Check the score of the Cardinals' game? Look at stltoday? Wear Nikes? Send your kids to public schools? Use an Android or Apple phone? Fly?

I do a lot of these things. I am weak. Most of us are.

We've been softened by wealth and convenience.

The only way to escape culpability for America's dismal future is incomprehensible to most Americans. It looks like this:

* Quit your job
* Sell most of what you own
* Buy a few acres with a simple cabin
* Grow your own produce and can it for winter
* Raise chickens for meat and eggs
* Hunt and fish for food
* Pray constantly

You'll still be supporting the utilities. Go further by giving up the air conditioning, heating with wood harvested from your land, and generating your own electricity with solar panels or a windmill.

If you're not completely off the grid, you're funding the enemies of America. It's that simple.

America is a sick society. The damn hippies were right about this. They were also right about the FBI, the CIA, the DOJ, and making your own deodorant. Or maybe they were just ahead of their times.

Sometime between the hippie era and today, America as a nation (not talking about you personally) rejected God and decided to go it alone. Most of the Old Testament is the story of God's chosen people trying to go it alone. Generation after generation abandoned God, became slaves, fought like cornered raccoons to free themselves, and said, "God, I'm sorry."

Our nation has tried for 60 years to go it alone. And it is now a slave nation.

We won't live to see the generation that fights like the Maccabbes for freedom to worship God as God commands. (Have you ever noticed that in the Bible, the only just reason for escaping slavery is the freedom to worship God as God commands? Could you read it and see.)?

Our freedom is always predicated on the promise that we would use our freedom to worship God as He commanded. Once we used our freedom for our own ends, we lost God's favor and protection. Now, there aren't enough of us left who want to worship God according to His commandments. Not in America, anyway. Therefore, we are all Jews in Babylon. We are Hebrews in Egypt. We are slaves to the world of which Satan is the prince.

And we have no one but ourselves to blame.

Pray. The only things left to save are our souls. And those are the only things that ever mattered, anyway.

Deo Gratias.
