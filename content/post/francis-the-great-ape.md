In 1948, then Monsignor Fulton Sheen warned the world that the Catholic Church would be eclipsed by a false religion. 

> In the midst of all his seeming love for humanity and his glib talk of freedom and equality, he will have one great secret which he will tell to no one: he will not believe in God. Because **his religion will be brotherhood without the fatherhood of God**, he will deceive even the elect. **He will set up a counterchurch which will be the ape of the Church, because he, the Devil, is the ape of God**. It will have all the notes and characteristics of the Church, but in reverse and **emptied of its divine content**. It will be a mystical body of the Antichrist that will in all externals resemble the mystical body of Christ. . . .
>
> — Fulton J. Sheen, 1948

No one alive today could better describe the Catholic Church under Jorge Bergoglio, aka "Pope Francis." 

And if Bergoglio's church is the ape of the Church, that makes Bergoglio the ape of a pope. The Great Ape who "speaks ex-cathedra. . . on the subject of economics and politics" and environmentalism and vaccines. 

Bergoglio's worst enemies could not indict him of these heresies and falsehoods any more viciously than Bergoglio indicts himself. Not once or twice but constantly. 

Just a few of Bergoglio's self-incriminating actions and statements:

* He never directly denied a report that he denied the divinity of Jesus Christ. "once incarnated, Jesus ceases to be a God and becomes a man until his death on the cross." The Vatican's supposed challenge to that quote was, "that's not exactly what he said." 
* He presided over a pagan, demonic idol worship service on the lawn of the Vatican and ordered the demonic idols to be venerated in St. Peter's Basilica. 
* He has directly refuted numerous times Christ's "Great Commission" to "baptize them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost." 
* He has obliquely rescinded Christ's teachings on divorce and remarriage, as wells St. Paul's and Leviticus's teachings on homosexuality. 
* He has technically denied Christ's teaching that He is "the way, the truth, and the life, and no one comes to the Father but through Me" by signing the Abu Dabhi Doctrine asserting that "**the pluralism and the diversity of religions**, color, sex, race and language **are willed by God** in his wisdom, through which he created human beings."

While no one could indict Bergoglio as viciously as Bergoglio himself, the great Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganó recently released a statement that gives Francis a run for his money. 

{{< figure src="/images/20180826t1030-19650-cns-vigano-testimony-mccarrick_0.jpg" caption="Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganó" title="America's Archbishop" >}}

Viganó's letter comes in response to the recently announced summit: "Exploring the Mind, Body, and Soul: Unite to Prevent & Unite to Cure." 

The Vatican conference is a who's who of anti-Christian, anti-God luminaries. (I will let Archbishop Viganó explain below.) The purpose of the summit is to help Big Pharma hawk more COVID genetically modifying injections around the world. 

The Vatican is pumping this dangerous farce, not as a matter of faith or morals, but, as Bishop Sheen described, a brotherhood of man absent the fatherhood of God. 

{{< tip >}}Archbishop Viganò has been in hiding since exposing Bergoglio's complicity in the McCarrick scandal. Enemies of this pope tend to get "suicided."{{< /tip >}}

Thanks be to God, we have Archbishop Viganó to property critique the Vatican's "antichristic" behavior. Here's what the great Archbishop has to say about the Bergoglio's latest apostacy. Let's begin with that rogue's gallery of speakers and reporters:

> Michael Haynes of LifeSiteNews has reported ([here](https://www.lifesitenews.com/news/vatican-to-host-conference-featuring-covid-jab-developers-big-tech-leaders-fauci-and-chelsea-clinton)) on the topics to be addressed and the participants, including the infamous **Anthony Fauci**, whose scandalous conflicts of interest did not prevent him from taking over the management of the pandemic in the United States; **Chelsea Clinton, a follower of the Church of Satan** and a staunch abortion advocate; the New Age guru **Deepak Chopra**; Dame Jane Goodall, environmentalist and chimpanzee expert; the **CEOs of Pfizer and Moderna**; representatives of **Big Tech**; and a whole slew of **abortionists**, **Malthusians**, and **globalists** known to the general public. The conference has recruited five prominent journalists to be moderators, who are exclusively from left-wing media outlets such as **CNN**, **MSNBC**, **CBS** and **Forbes**.

Mind you, Bergoglio did not invite these characters to evangelize them and convert them, but to honor them and help them store up riches on earth. (Bergoglio once chastised a woman for helping a young African man concert to Catholicism.)

Next, Viganó eviscerates the popes long practice of denouncing Christianity while worshiping humanism:

> This Conference – along with the Council for Inclusive Capitalism of Lynn Forester de Rothschild, the Global Compact on Education, and the inter-religious Pantheon to be held in June in Astana, Kazakhstan – is the **umpteenth scandalous confirmation of a disturbing departure of the current Hierarchy, and in particular its highest Roman members, from Catholic orthodoxy.**

Viganó is just warming up. 

> **The Holy See has deliberately renounced the supernatural mission of the Church**, making itself the **servant** of the **New World Order** and **Masonic globalism** in an **_antichristic_** **counter-magisterium**.

"Antichristic counter-magisterium." Boom!

There it is, folks. The perfect description of Bergoglio's "pontifacte." An antichristic _counter_-magisterium. 

If Bergoglio's "magisterium" is, in fact, antichristic, faithful Catholics are prohibited from obeying it. It doesn't matter if the pope was licitly installed. Once he strays into heresy, he is no longer the pope. As we learn from St. John Bellarmine:

> the Holy Fathers teach unanimously **not only that heretics are outside of the Church, but also that they are “ipso facto” deprived of all ecclesiastical jurisdiction and dignity**. St. Cyprian (lib. 2, epist. 6) says: “We affirm that absolutely no heretic or schismatic has any power or right”; and he also teaches (lib. 2, epist. 1) that the **heretics who return to the Church must be received as laymen, even though they have been formerly priests or bishops in the Church**. St. Optatus (lib. 1 cont. Parmen.) teaches that **heretics and schismatics cannot have the keys of the kingdom of heaven, nor bind nor loose**. St. Ambrose (lib. 1 de poenit., ca. 2), St. Augustine (in Enchir., cap 65), St. Jerome (lib. cont. Lucifer.) teach the same.
